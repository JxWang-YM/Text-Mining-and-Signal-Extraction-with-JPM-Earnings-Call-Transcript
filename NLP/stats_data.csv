JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.1 billion and EPS of $2.68 on record revenue of $30.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 18%. Underlying performance continues to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in Home Lending and Auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in Card; #1 in global IB fees year-to-date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw record AUM and client assets. Overall for the firm, total loans were flat year-on-year, which includes continued mortgage loan sales. [FC] sales loans were up 3% on healthy growth in Card and AUM. Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail. And credit performance remained strong across business. On to Page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year-on-year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year-on-year or 14%, driven by strong performance across Fixed Income Markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million. Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.5 billion, reflecting modest net reserve builds and charge-offs in line with expectations. And as we mentioned last quarter, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale. Now onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, up about 10 basis points versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.6 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. Now on to Page 4 for a look at our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year-on-year. Revenue of $14.3 billion was up 7% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels. Revenue was up 5%, driven by higher NII on deposit growth and margin expansion as well higher noninterest revenue on higher transaction volumes. And even though the deposit margin is higher year-on-year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter-on-quarter given the current rate environment. Home Lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales. With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to Home Lending revenue is minimal with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from Corporate. And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, and merchant processing volume was up 11%. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build in card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in Home Lending and $50 million in Business Banking. The build in Cards was primarily driven by mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $2.8 billion and an ROE of 13% on revenue of $9.3 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year in a market that was down. It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory. Year-to-date, we continue to rank #1 in overall IB wallet and gain share across products and regions, benefiting from our leadership positions in the technology and health care sectors. In advisory, we were down 13% year-on-year, reflecting lower deal activity compared to a strong prior year. However, we continue to gain wallet share, driven by our strategic investments. In debt underwriting, we were up 17% year-on-year in a market that was down. Here, we benefited from our participation in some large transactions and increased activity in investment-grade bonds. In equity underwriting, we were up 22% year-on-year, significantly outperforming the market, driven by our strong performance in IPOs and convertibles. And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked #1 in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth quarter IBCs to be down both sequentially and year-on-year driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year. However, the pipeline remains healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $5.1 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Fixed Income Markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year. This quarter was characterized by strong client activity across the board with outperformance in agency mortgage trading and improved flows in rates and commodities. Equity Markets was down 5% against a very strong third quarter last year. Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 7% and 2% year-on-year, respectively. The rate environment remains a relative headwind, primarily from the funding basis compression we've been talking about, which is largely firm-wide neutral, and to a lesser extent, client-specific repricing in Treasury Services. But importantly, the organic growth in fees and balances continues to be strong. Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges. And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades. Now moving onto Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $937 million and an ROE of 16%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to strong investment banking performance. Gross Investment Banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year-on-year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market. Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year-on-year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges. Deposit balances were up 3% year-on-year on strong client flows. Loan balances were flat year-on-year across both C&I and CRE. In C&I, while we are seeing pockets of growth in select industries, like financial institutions, technology and energy, there does continue to be significant runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in Commercial Term Lending, it was largely offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $668 million with pretax margin of 25% and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments in technology and advisers, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees. Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs as well as reserve builds on loan growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $40 billion, driven by fixed income, and net liquidity inflows of $24 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both records, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels. Deposits were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 7% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $393 million. Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates. This quarter also included small net gains on certain legacy private equity investments compared to approximately $200 million of net losses in the prior year. And expenses of $281 million were up $253 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher investments in technology and a prior year net legal benefit. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Our full year outlook remains in line with previous guidance. We expect net interest income to come in slightly below $57.5 billion, based on the latest implieds, and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65.5 billion. So to wrap up, the U.S. economy is on solid footing. And while global growth is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Despite continued macro uncertainty and headwinds from the rate environment, this quarter showcases the diversification and scale of our business model. We remain well positioned to outperform in any environment, and we'll continue to strategically invest in our businesses. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Questions and Answers
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third quarter results.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Well, I'll try. So in terms of balance sheet positioning, as you know, we have a negatively convexed balance sheet. We manage it in both directions. Some moves in interest rates are hedge-able and some are not. In a quarter like we just had, with the rally that we had, you would expect us to buy duration and we did. And so but in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter just under $14 billion. Frankly, that's not a bad place to start. There will be some puts and takes. Obviously, you would have to get the full run rate of the October cut because, of course, this is all based on the implieds, and then there's one more cut next year. But an offset to that, at least a partial offset to that, would be balance sheet growth and mix. So we'll give you more color at Investor Day, as we always do, and we'll be in a better position then. But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So as it relates to GSIB, we fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end. As you know, most aspects of GSIB are on a spot basis, so we will manage it like we do any scarce resource and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. What we need to do across the various GSIB buckets will not be obvious in our fourth quarter results. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket. It's more than just leverage.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. I think -- well, I'll come back to investment securities balances. But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think of that largely in deposits. And just as one example, obviously, the rate environment and the economy will matter a whole lot. But just in a declining rate environment, the higher-yielding alternatives for consumers are less attractive. And so we do expect to continue to grow the franchise. And we could see healthy growth in the deposit base. So that's what I was referring to. In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on. As I said earlier, we did buy duration. But importantly, what you see in investment securities are also cash deployment strategies as well as actions we took on the back of the mortgage loan sales. So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Okay. Sure. So I'll start, and if you want to add. So I would say, Mike, the NII guidance
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people. We think about the productivity of the people. So the number of calls that they're able to take because you may have more people because of more volume, but that's good, healthy volume with top line growth. But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty. But broadly speaking, while it's slower growth, it's still growth. As I said, the U.S. consumer is incredibly strong. Consumer spending is strong. Sentiment is strong for the consumer, credit is good. And it is true that if you look at the ISM surveys, both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, they were recently disappointing. So I would say, no doubt, cautionary signs, but credit remains very good, and there's still very healthy business activity.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So I mean there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds, as the implieds play out. We're not immune to that. But as I said earlier, there is at least a partial offset to that in growth. And so we still feel very good about the underlying growth that we're seeing there. And then just in terms of reprice, obviously, there's very little movement on the back of the Fed ease, given there was very little movement on the way up. And in fact, quarter-over-quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest-bearing. But we love the platform. The branch expansion is going very, very well. And so we feel great about the continued growth there, but we won't be immune to rate headwinds.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on the IB pipeline, I would say it's healthy, although we do expect to be down in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year, on very strong performances in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year. But overall, it feels healthy. And I would say geographically, largely it's on strength in the U.S.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Okay. Sure. So first on securities yield, so that did play a role, Marty. But more importantly, the impact on securities yields came from mix and just lower rates overall. So predominantly mix and lower rate, and then to a lesser extent, your point on prepaid as well as a little bit of day counts. And then on betas, broadly speaking, we'd say betas are symmetric. And so if you look at the retail side, as I said before, very little movement on a Fed ease. And we did see rates paid even tick up a little bit there quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, there's obviously more opportunity to reprice, but we do that client by client. And we're not going to lose valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And so what we saw there, as you might expect, in CIB, rates paid down quarter-over-quarter. And then we also saw rates pay down in both AWM and the Commercial Bank, but a little bit less so.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter. We do think we'll continue to see deposit margin compression there on the retail side. We have come off the peaks in terms of CD pricing, but you still have slight migration there into interest-bearing products.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So look, I think it's difficult to know. I think in a declining rate environment, as I said, I think the higher-yielding alternatives are obviously less attractive for consumers. We do still see good organic growth in wholesale as well in both Treasury Services and Securities Services. So I think it's difficult to know. The macro environment will be a big determinant.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. There it's really just timing. There's just seasonality there. So at Investor Day, we said that the card revenue rate would be 11.50%, plus or minus. But fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, and so we still expect to hit that 11.50%, plus or minus, for the full year guidance, so just seasonality.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes, very different dynamic there.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So I mean we're doing that based on the latest implieds. And it's obviously early days. We're working through our budget process as we speak. So it's based on the latest implieds, which have a cut in October and a cut in April. And 10-year, call it 1.70% plus or minus. So relative to where we might have been just a couple of months ago, or even weeks ago, it might have been a different outlook. So I think it's important to take it with a health warning that's on the latest implied because that is, of course, what we know.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: And it's assuming some...
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right. It would be worse. The balance sheet growth is a partial offset to a larger impact from just rates.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: There, I would just say you can look at the earnings at risk that we'll have in the Q. I mean that's probably the best way to think about it. Because that is not an NII sensitivity, but it is an interest rate sensitivity. And so that'll be out in a few weeks.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. In equity derivatives, it was a combination of weaker client activity and some losses on inventory, but it wasn't meaningful. Those losses were certainly not meaningful in the grand scheme of things, but they were part of the equity derivatives story.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: No, no, no.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion. We've done a ton of work, as you say, and a lot of modeling. The range is still between $4 billion and $6 billion. And we'll be able to be more precise, obviously, as we prepare for the January 1 implementation.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: It was not meaningful, whatever it is.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So the majority of our customers in You Invest already trade for free, and so we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. As we think about You Invest, it is one component of our broader investment strategy. And as I said, we're really proud of this quarter's results with client investment assets being up 13%. It was an important product launch for us in terms of meeting an unmet need with our existing customers, but we're pleased to see the market moving toward us.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Thank you.",0.23,-0.4710000000000023,0,0.11573527109505294,0.12675465261862315
1,Q3_2018,"
MARIANNE LAKE, EXECUTIVE VP & CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.4 billion and EPS of $2.34 on revenue of $27.8 billion, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. The results this quarter were strong. Record net income for a third quarter, even excluding the impact of tax reform, with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses, reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios. Highlights include average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 6% year-on-year, card and debit sales as well as client investment assets and merchant processing volumes in Consumer were all up double digits. We gained share in global IB fees and across all regions year-to-date. And in Asset & Wealth Management, AUM and client assets were both up 7%. Turning to Page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Revenue of $27.8 billion was up $1.4 billion or 5% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rates net of lower Markets NII as well as loan and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was up $425 million driven by Markets NIR and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments. Expense of $15.6 billion was up 7% year-on-year. More than half of the increase relates to investments we're making in technology, marketing, bankers broadly defined and real estate. And the remainder is driven by revenue-related costs, principally higher Auto lease depreciation and transaction expenses on higher volumes. Credit trends remain favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. For the quarter, credit costs of $950 million were down $500 million year-on-year, driven by changes in Consumer reserves. Briefly on Page 3, turning to balance sheet and capital. There's little to say here other than as you can see, capital and risk-weighted assets remain basically flat quarter-on-quarter, with a CET1 ratio of 12%. Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $4.1 billion of net income and an ROE of 31%. Core loans were up 6% year-on-year driven by Home Lending, up 10%; Business Banking, up 5%; Card, up 4%; and Auto loans and leases, up 3%. Deposits grew 4% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the industry although slower than a year ago. According to the recently released FDIC annual survey, we grew at nearly 2x the average, and we were the fastest-growing bank in 9 of our top 10 markets. Chase Auto lands the #1 spot in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows more than doubling year-on-year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth. Card sales volume was up 12%, with strength across our portfolio, and we also saw very strong debit sales performance, up 13%. Revenue of $13.3 billion was up 10%. Consumer & Business Banking revenue, up 18% on higher NII driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was down 16% as higher rates drive loan spread compression and a smaller market pressuring production margins. In addition, net servicing revenue was down including the MSR. Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 10% driven by higher Card NII on margin expansion and loan growth, higher net Card fees on lower acquisition costs, substantially offset by lower net interchange and also on higher Auto lease volumes. Expense of $7 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in technology and by Auto lease depreciation. The overhead ratio was 53%. Finally, on Credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, we built reserves in Card of $150 million, largely driven by growth. And we released reserves in the Home Lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvement in home prices and delinquencies. On charge-offs, there are a few moving pieces. Year-on-year, charge-offs were down $137 million, driven by a recovery from a reperforming loan sale in Home Lending this quarter of about $80 million together with an approximately $50 million charge-off adjustment in Auto this period last year. Excluding those charge-offs, we're about flat, but we are seeing improvement across all portfolios except for Card. And in Card, while charge-offs are up as newer vintages season, they are up less than expected as credit performance remains very strong. At this point, we expect Card charge-off rates for the year to be below our guidance at about 310 basis points. Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.6 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $8.8 billion, up 2%. In banking, we maintained our #1 ranking year-to-date in global IB fees as well as in North America and EMEA and gained share across regions. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was flat to a strong prior year, and we outperformed in a market that was down meaningfully as we saw robust activity, particularly in ECM. Equity underwriting fees were up 40%, gaining share across all products, with continued strength in IPOs, particularly in technology and health care. Advisory fees were down 6% compared to a third quarter record last year, outperforming the market and gaining share year-to-date. And debt underwriting fees were down 11% although better than the market, as our strong lead-left positions drove share gains. Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong, up solidly from the prior year across products. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $4.4 billion, down 2% or up 1% when adjusting for the impact of tax reform. So another good performance. Fixed Income Markets revenue was down 6% adjusted with no single predominant driver. We saw mild weakness in Rates, Financing, Credit Trading and Securitized Products as a result of compressed margins and tighter financing spreads in range-bound and competitive markets. This was partially offset by higher activity levels in emerging markets on volatility and commodities returning to more normal levels relative to a weaker prior year. Equities continued the momentum from previous quarters and was up across all segments on the back of strong client activity. Equities revenue was up 17%, reflecting continued share gains in cash and prime and strong performance in corporate derivatives. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenue were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, up 12% and 5% year-on-year, respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. And Securities Services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity. Quarter-on-quarter, Securities Services revenue was down principally on seasonality and the impact of a business exit. Finally, expense of $5.2 billion was up 8% driven by higher legal expense, higher compensation expense as we invest in technology and bankers and volume-related transaction costs. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Another strong quarter for this business, with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $581 million was flat, although we saw a strong underlying flow of business, and pipelines remain robust and active. On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environments, as expected, balances are down year-on-year and bases are trending higher as we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher-yielding investments. Expense of $853 million was up 7% as we continue to invest in the business, in banker coverage and technology initiatives. Loan balances were up 4% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. In C&I, demand remains muted in the wake of tax reform. As well, client confidence is high, balance sheets are strong and liquid and the environment is competitive. For us, C&I loans were up 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially, in line with the industry. But if you decompose it, we're growing strongly in our expansion markets and specialized industries, growing solidly in our core markets but are seeing notable offsets in tax-exempt activity given the mix of our business. CRE loans were up 3% year-on-year, a little less than the industry as we are seeing increased competition and continue to be very selective. Finally, credit performance remains strong, with net recoveries of 3 basis points. Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $724 million, with a pretax margin of 27% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products. These were partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains including on seed capital investments. Additionally, banking results were strong. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investment in advisers and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $8 billion, with positive flows across all asset classes. In addition, we saw net liquidity inflows of $14 billion. AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both up 7%, with more than half of the increase being driven by flows and the remainder on higher markets. Deposits were down 8% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments with us and down 5% sequentially including seasonality. Finally, we had loan balances up 12%, with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $145 million. Treasury and CIO net income was up year-on-year primarily driven by higher rates. Other Corporate was a net loss of $241 million, including markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments of $220 million pretax. For the whole company, legal costs were a modest negative, with the benefit here in Other Corporate being more than offset in the CIB. Moving to Page 9 and outlook. We recently gave you updated outlook. So unsurprisingly, that still holds and it's here on the page. Only 2 things of note. Our expense outlook assumes that the FDIC surcharge ended this quarter. So clearly, an extension would pose a risk. And on tax, there are a number of questions in the rules which we expect to be clarified by the end of the year. We will have to work through them but would not expect any changes to be material. So to close, we are growing across most of our businesses. We're investing heavily in all of them. We're investing in technology, bankers and beyond. Credit is in great shape, and the earnings power of the company is evident. We are particularly proud of the strength and improvement in customer satisfaction broadly and our continued investments, which drive leadership positions and market share gains. This quarter, we announced Sapphire Banking and our digital investing platform, You Invest. We opened our first branch as part of our expansion strategy in Washington, D.C., announced additional expansion into Philadelphia and Boston and also announced our advancing cities initiative as we invest for growth in the clients and communities that we serve. With that, operator, please open up the lines to Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say -- I would sort of pick up on the tone that you had in your question, which is the level of rates is not surprisingly high. And so from our vantage point, we're not seeing anything in terms of looking at our client dialogue or, for that matter, at the credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic. With higher rates, and we do this all the time, we obviously look at all of our portfolios and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points, even up 200, although, clearly where we are now, risks are more asymmetric but -- I mean, more symmetric. But there doesn't seem to be any extraordinary stress that becomes evident even if you -obviously, the margin, you're going to get more, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming. And it speaks, I think, to the fact that low rates have been around for a long time. People have had the chance to get prepared. There is a lot of liquidity. And in the corporate space, in particular, people have been able to hedge. So is there an absolute level of rates where things can be problematic? At some point, but we don't think we're anywhere near there. So I'm not saying that there couldn't be select downgrades. I'm not saying that at the margin, there may not be some incremental stress if rates continue to go much higher, but that's not where we are right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean, remember, You Invest, it's early. Jamie just said, I don't know if you heard it, yes and yes. Clearly, we are trying to add products and capabilities and value to our existing clients in an effort to continue to drive loyalty and engagement and also earn more share of their wallet. But we do think that the proposition is compelling and that the pricing is disruptive, and we should also expect, over time, to be able to attract new accounts. So yes and yes. But it's early days. We're going to continue to develop You Invest, its capabilities, iterate it and improve it. So far, it's early but good.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so the answer is generically, yes, as we would've expected. Obviously, we have no crystal ball as to the sort of timing and path of these things, but it is playing out arguably a little slower than we thought but like we thought. And I would say that our outlook for deposit growth is for it to be slower but still positive.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, on the asset side of the balance sheet, just a big rule of thumb is that a little less than half of our loans are variable, indexed to prime and LIBOR. And so what we've been seeing -- in any one quarter, there can be noise on onetime items or mix or whatever else. But largely speaking, for every rate hike we've been seeing on the front end, we're seeing our assets repriced about half of that and that -- or our loans repriced about half of that, and that's what we'd expect. Similarly, if we see sustained increases in the long end of the curve, then we would see that play through into our investment securities yield. Obviously, this quarter, while there was a meaningful increase on a spot basis, on an average basis, that wasn't the case and particularly not for mortgages. So it had a modest impact on investment security yields this quarter. But again, if it was sustained and more sizeable, we would see that pass through, yes... and we would rotate the assets into higher book yields over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: So this is the Interbank Information Network which we talked about at Investor Day, and now we have I think 75 banks and growing signed up to it. I wouldn't necessarily look at it exactly like that. I would say this use case, at least for now, is very much around reducing the friction in the Wholesale payment space in terms of inquiry and information sharing and not at this point about processing payments. So we are still exploring use cases across-the-board on blockchain. I'm very excited about this; and the uptake, it will be, I think meaningful, but I wouldn't think of it that way. Not yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I need to start by saying, I mean, there's a lot of sort of macro uncertainty noise and overhang that have been affecting the markets over the last few days. So overthinking any one driver or sort of conclusion I think might be challenging. I would say that as we look at the economy, we don't see it slowing down. It seems to be continuing to grow pretty solidly. There is divergence around the world. So it's led by U.S. strength but still expecting there to be more convergence going forward. So I actually think that our outlook is still quite optimistic on the global economy, not to say, to Jamie's point, that there aren't some risks out there. And so as we -- and also just to talk about monetary policy for a second. Everything, given that growth outlook, is really sort of lining up for a December rate hike and for more hikes into 2019 and the continuation, hopefully, of a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks. It is definitely the case that as we've been talking about for years now, as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet and liquidity is coming out of the system, yes, we are seeing deposit growth flow, and there's a natural feedback loop; as you reprice liabilities, you'll have a natural asset-based response. And so you might have slower growth on the asset side relative to the past, but it should be at higher spreads and that should be how it plays out. So there's really no change, I don't think, in our expectation of the drivers.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I'll try and remember all of that. First of all, I would just clarify that when you say Wholesale loan growth has been outpacing the industry, I would say that, from my recollection, over the course of the last several quarters, we've basically been saying in line with, if not maybe even slightly less than in line with the industry. But it is nuanced. You need to get beneath it. There are areas where we would fully expect to be growing more strongly than the industry, and those are in our newer expansion markets where we've been investing; we're reaping the benefits of those investments and we're growing from a smaller base and deepening into the market. In our core markets, the mature markets, in line to maybe not even quite as we are being cautious given where we are in the cycle. So I just want to clarify that...
MARIANNE LAKE: We haven't materially changed our underwriting standards, no. And if anything, I would say we're just being cautious at the margin. And with respect to competition outside of banks, it's definitely true that nonbanks are gaining share and it's also true that they are, structure-wise, going to be willing to do and are willing to do things that we are not. And so for our best clients, we aren't largely going to lose on price. We would be willing to work on price, but we would walk away on structure.
MARIANNE LAKE: No. That's right.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Actually, just before we get into expense for a second, if you step back, just a couple of things. I wouldn't look at any one quarter when I'm thinking about like operating leverage. Not to overplay seasonality or anything else, but I would look at the whole year. And tax reform is an important part of that. So if you look at year-to-date on a reported basis rather than a managed basis, year-over-year, year-to-date, we have about 200 basis points of positive leverage. So tax reform is a big factor. And then, obviously, we had some private equity losses, which are episodic in this quarter's revenue print. So I think that there's strong growth across the businesses. The expense number in investments, our expenses are up over $1 billion year-on-year, in line -- outside of FDIC and revenue-related costs, in line with the guidance we gave at Investor Day. So think about that sort of $2.7 billion of year-over-year investment, and we're working through it. So we're on track. It's different from revenues insofar as it's more linear and so expenses are in line and leverage is -- positive leverage is, I think, pretty strong.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: I also think -- I mean, not exactly, but if you went back and looked, a couple of years ago, at what the 2-year forward 10-year rate would look like, it would look much like this, and so it's just that it's been -because the covers having a hard time pushing up that people are now focused on it, but this is what we would've expected, should expect and higher.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so when we think about the sort of... well, so it's not really about competition, particularly. When we think about the deposit base and the retail consumer relationship, deposit and rate pace is an important part of it but it's increasingly less important, not that it's not significant. And so when you think about the value that we give to our customers, it's not just that, but it's also all of the customer experience initiatives that we've had. It's about convenience. It's about digital, mobile capabilities. It's about launching new products, new services, simplifying the environment for them. So there's a lot of different investments and things to play, which might make this kind of normalization cycle look a little different. And so the way we think about it is, we look carefully across the spectrum of deposits, Retail and Wholesale, at what we are seeing in terms of flows and balances and elasticity for our customers on our balance sheet. And that's how we think about our strategy for deposit reprice, and it's sort of largely behaving as we would have expected.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I would say -- first of all, obviously, we'll give you more thoughts on forward-looking guidance at a future date. But just generically, I wouldn't really put tax reform as being a primary reason for what we're doing on investments. I would say that we have identified the opportunity to accelerate capabilities that are consistent with our client's strategic long-term goals, and so we've been leaning into that this year. And so it was a pretty sizable step-up this year. Acknowledging that, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that continue. But we're going to carry on investing in technology, adding bankers, opening branches, launching new products so that we're sort of defending the long-term growth and profitability of the company. And in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that we're still targeting -- not targeting, but we're still expecting an overhead ratio to be around about the mid-50s over the medium term which, on revenue growth, implies we'll continue to invest. And there's also volume-related costs associated with that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. So you hit the nail on the head with both your question and your -- what that could imply. It is a big area of uncertainty. We do not have clarity on capital broadly as it relates to CECL, including whether there will be permanent capital relief and/or how that will play into CCAR. It is one of the most open thing -- open questions we have. So right now, what we know is, as far as I know anyway, that we don't have to put the CCAR impact in until -- sorry, the CECL impact in until CCAR 2020. So it's not a sort of imminent question, but it's an important one, and we don't know the answer.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's the danger for sure. So we would encourage the dialogue on clarifying capital treatments [writ] large to be at the forefront of standard-setters' minds and regulators...
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, yes. So Mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are on higher rates expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year-on-year. We are down -- in line maybe a little more than that, but for us it's a tale of two channels. We are flat year-on-year in the Consumer channels, so a decent consumer engagement and purchase market share. And we're down meaningfully in Correspondent because we are pricing for the risk in higher rates. With respect to would we be willing to reconsider our position on mortgage, the narrative, the dialogue is constructive but there hasn't actually been any resolution to the bigger challenges. So if we can get that resolution, then that I think the answer would be largely, yes. Jamie?
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. And you're right, there's excess capacity in the market right now, and that will clear -- it will clear itself out over the course of the coming months. And we're in this for relationships, not volumes. And margins are under pressure as a result, but they will stabilize.
MARIANNE LAKE: A risk of what, sorry?
MARIANNE LAKE: No. Yes -- no, no. Okay, so...
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say on the margin point, it's been the case that for -- particularly in the sort of more liquid space, you've seen margins coming down consistently over the years. And we've -- it's not necessarily that this is some sort of step change or a new phenomenon, but it's competitive, and so that's what we're seeing. On the SPG side, pipelines aren't strong at this point so we expect fourth quarter to feel much like the third.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Sure, okay. So as you know, we've been talking for a couple of years now about the fact that we did some targeted credit expansion in the Card space a few years back. And naturally, as that seasons, it will -- and our risk-adjusted returns are healthy, but underwriting loans at higher loss rates, which means as that seasons, that the overall portfolio loss rate will naturally increase. So the higher the percentage of newer vintages are, the higher the loss rate will be in accordance with our underwriting standards and at good risk-adjusted returns. So that's something we've been tracking and guiding to and expecting. The build this quarter was more about loan growth than it was about the seasoning of the charge-off rate, but it was a bit of both. My comment about the performance, though, is if we had looked at the 2018 Card loss rate, as we did at the beginning of the year, we said we would have expected it to be closer to 3.25%. But there are 3 things driving it to be slightly better. The first is the pre-expansion vintages are holding up very well. So the sort of pre-2015 vintages continue to hold up very well. The second is that as we have continued to observe the newer vintages, we've been rigorous in terms of, at the margin, doing risk pullbacks and ensuring we're managing the performance really well. And the third is that we've been improving our collection strategy. So a combination of factors have allowed us to deliver apples to apples a charge-off rate for the portfolio that's a little better than we would've expected coming into the year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. And obviously, in this portfolio, as we go through the cycle, we would expect charge-off rates to continue to rise, and that's one of the reasons why I emphasize that the pre-expansion vintages continue to be that kind of -- you'll remember, we hit that 2.5% charge-off rate, which is extraordinarily low for this kind of portfolio. And we're still there for those pre-expansion vintages. So naturally, as the cycle matures, we will see that rise. But we aren't seeing it yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So on the loan side in Auto, I would say that we have -- we are losing share as we see competition from credit unions and captives that may have economic frameworks that are different from ours. We are not going to chase volume. We're going to get the appropriate return for the risk. So we are -- our credit reflects our discipline on pricing and underwriting standards. And so it is continuing to be flat to a little better. On the leasing side, we do leasing with our manufacturing partners. We are seeing very strong growth. We're very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but it's very high-quality growth. And that looks set to continue.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, more the latter than the former. So obviously, we have a view of what we think the right return profile for these businesses should look like and we're investing to deliver those returns through the cycle and over the long term. So we don't have an operating leverage target in mind when we set our investment strategy, nor do we, for that matter, have an expense target in mind either. So again, we saw a reasonable step-up year-on-year this year because we saw the opportunity to do that well. I wouldn't necessarily expect to see that kind of growth. But again, operating leverage is more of an outcome, not entirely, but more of an outcome than an input.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, and mix.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So yes, I appreciate that you guys have been asking about this now for a while, and I hate to tell you that the modeling, the data, the methodologies are complicated. So operationally, we are working through that across all of our businesses. We continue to expect to be running in parallel through some parts of 2019 across some of our portfolio so that we can make sure that we fully understand the potential implications. We don't have a number for you, but I will tell you this. Same as I said I think last time, the biggest driver is likely to be Card because of the size of the portfolio and the 12 months incurred a loss model today. So the weighted average life of the portfolio driven by revolvers would be longer than that, most likely. There'll be some other impacts, pluses and minuses. Research reports have been written. They've -- I think, on average, for those that have been written, have suggested not just for us but across others that the reserve increase could be 20% to 30%. And while I don't have a number for you, it's not implausible.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I think if you go back a number, number of years when we were all having those like deep and meaningful debates about whether we should be changing our sort of FICC operating model and we were committed to the sort of full spectrum, complete platform, you roll forward to 2016, there was outperformance in fixed income and coming in -- and people had made changes to their operating model and operations and the competition came back pretty fiercely, I would say, into 2017. And then in 2017, the market didn't play nicely, particularly the volatility and volumes were less robust than they had been in 2016. But we haven't seen the competition let up. So people are back and wanting to enjoy -- Jamie just talked about it, the fixed income wallet will double, and there are -- pretty much everyone, everywhere wants to enjoy some of that. And so the competition -- it's a combination of it's been a very competitive for a while, and it continues to be so. So I don't think it's a step change, but it does, obviously, feel -- particularly when volatility has been reasonably contained outside of specific emerging market kind of areas -- that everybody is competing for these thin margins.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I mean, if you think about the -- we're sort of gaining share most notably in cash and prime. And if you go back a number of years ago, we were pretty open and honest about the fact that we weren't where we needed to be in either of those 2 scenarios, and we have been consistently investing in the platform. And it is technology, think about prime with -- building out of the prime platform, particularly internationally, has been a game changer. And we had a best-in-class competitive offering over the course of the last couple of years. And now we're getting the momentum of being able to deliver that to clients. And similarly, we've been investing in the cash side. So it's across the complex, but we're getting the benefits of the investments we've been making. I also think that the sort of relationship effect of having our equities business with our private bank and with the Commercial Bank, the sort of feedback loop is also quite powerful. So it has a little bit to do with our operating model, our platform as a company.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, great research.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, so from an underlying growth trend perspective, I would look year-over-year rather than sequentially. I sort of pointed out a sequential point because of seasonality, we also exited U.S. broker-dealer business. So that, obviously, has an impact. It is also the case -- so if you think about the year-on-year growth of 5%, we had been growing more than that, led by very strong growth in NII. For this business, this is a Wholesale business where deposit betas are high, so we would expect that growth to level off. And in this quarter in particular, just the specifics of our internal transfer pricing, is that LIBOR OAS narrows and it does have an impact. Year-over-year, continue to expect us to grow asset, asset-based fees, NII solidly but not as strongly and transaction. So I don't know whether it's going to be high single digits or mid-single digits growth year-on-year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, not on the retail side, not yet. I mean, there's not a sufficiently compelling rate differential to be driving interproduct migration on the retail side yet, but we are seeing it on the Wholesale side.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So commercial loans, we're 4% up year-on-year, flat to 1% up sequentially. At this point, as we look forward over the near term, it feels like that kind of steady growth, GDP-plus, GDP, is what we're going to get. And remember, we're -- everybody has a different mix, but one of the things that happen quickly with tax reform is that the sort of government health care hospital not-for-profit space was less compelling from a loan sense than our -- they'll be more compelling in the capital markets. So we're seeing that impact our growth down. So I would say that kind of not quite mid-single-digit growth feels like a decent outlook, all other things being equal. In terms of the capital markets, well, I would say that the third quarter pipelines coming out into fourth quarter and momentum sets us up for a decent fourth quarter, honestly, across products. Clearly, volatility, depending upon how long it stays around and what the drivers are, can impact business confidence. We're not necessarily expecting that. So I would still say the outlook across products is good, with ECM obviously being the one that would be most likely impacted. But even there, I think it might be more of a sort of temporary set of pauses as people see how everything is digested. And honestly on Markets, no good ever comes of trying to predict what a quarter will look like after a couple of weeks. And volatility is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be constructive for some -- in some ways and less in others. So -- yes, there's no good coming of a prediction at this point. I will say one thing about Markets, just to give you guys a tiny view, which I know you know. But just because of tax reform and another one-off item in the fourth quarter, flat year-on-year, flat year-on-year comparably would be up.
MARIANNE LAKE: I mean, so it's difficult to generalize. And obviously, everybody has a sort of different risk appetite. It might be fine if you're getting properly paid to grow more quickly. We are sticking with our guns in terms of our underwriting and risk appetite on credit. The other thing I think you have to bear in mind, and again, it depends on the particular situation of any competitor, is that we are materially and increasingly bound by standardized risk-weighted assets. And so while we don't overthink that, and we do honestly think about economic capital, at some level, we have to generate a positive return for shareholders and shareholder value. And it's -- on these very high credit quality loans that we're producing, it's expensive.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I would say, if you look at the first 4 hikes, it was relatively muted deposit reprice across the complex. It accelerated for the last 3 hikes. I'm excluding September given, obviously, when it happened. So we are seeing an acceleration in betas. And it started at the top end of Wholesale and it will migrate through the complex over time. I would say, it's in line to arguably better than we would have modeled. But remember that this cycle did start at a very different place. So while if we looked at history, we might have seen reprice in totality having been higher at this point, we started at 100 basis points of rates, not 25. So I think that, that plays into it too. So generally, in line with expectations is what I would say.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say, yes. Obviously, it depends on how you position the company over that period. But we talked about it before. We were and have consistently been relatively short the market. We've been keeping dry powder so we could invest as the long end of rates goes up, and we still are looking at that. Obviously, there's complexity in the portfolio too, so paying attention to that. Yes, I agree.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So obviously, I don't know exactly your sort of mental model, but let me tell you this. I think you're right. I don't know about the 80% to 90% specifically, but you're right about net interest margin if you look through any short-term noise. So we would expect the trend for our firm-wide and core NIM to be -- to trend or grind higher over time but it does depend on the path and pace of reprice. So if we continue to see deposit betas stay low or lower than potentially a linear kind of move, you'll see margins increase. And then as they accelerate back to target, you might even see it compress. But if you see through that, over the long run, yes, net interest margins will be higher, and that will be driven mainly by balance sheet growth, mix and long end of rates. At Investor Day, you might remember we told you that beyond 2018, net-net, there was little rate left to go and it was going to be more about balance sheet mix and growth and long end of rates a little compounding. But the path does matter. So you can see core NIM, in particular, will be very, very vulnerable to the price -- to the pace of reprice. [Why would you look through that?]
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, everyone.",0.09999999999999963,2.2600000000000007,1,0.09097056518863585,0.11764908980829383
2,Q4_2010,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: This is Jamie for one second. So Doug, I just want to reiterate, a lot of you raised the question that reserves came down by $2 billion. On this page, you see them coming down by approximately $1 billion and the difference is the $600 million, which we have accelerated charge-offs, which are already recognized and reserves taken down and then this other $400 million, which is all various wholesale type stuff. So there is a little confusion out there about where that came from, but the $600 million obviously as a timing difference didn't affect income. Charge-offs were accelerated, reserves were taken down.
JAMIE DIMON: And that they do.
JAMIE DIMON: So Corporate NIM will be down quite a bit, the dollar amount, but we have given you the guidance in that and Card will be down $500 million or $600 million as it runs off and the home equity -- the run-off in mortgage is about $700 million (multiple speakers). Those will be disappearing next year.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't really know yet because it is hard to tell, but Card -- what we said is it will start to grow maybe late in the year because most of the run-off will be gone, but the mortgage stuff will be running off for years.
JAMIE DIMON: We may even not replace it and Corporate is completely discretionary. And we have decided to reduce the exposures in some of the portfolios there, reducing Corporate net interest income.
JAMIE DIMON: I think early in the year, we will probably be expensing that stuff, but you all -- a lot of you have done your own numbers showing that we are probably fully reserved. So once it is really determined we are fully reserved, we will probably be hitting that against the reserve.
JAMIE DIMON: It has got nothing to do with claims coming in per se. We make our own judgments about how we are going to go about handling it. Most of it will be securities litigation. You all, again, have done your own estimates in that and those range from -- for us -- $3 billion to $10 billion or $12 billion or something like that. I think the way to look at it is we've, and maybe uniquely, have put up litigation reserves for it and we don't know what the ultimate number could be. We can be higher or lower. We are not saying we are done, but it is going to be years before this plays out. And this litigation is going to be fought almost securitization by securitization. There is almost no other way to do it. Very high -- you have got causality. The reps and warrantees are low. You have got to do it loan-by-loan. It is going to be a long ugly mess. The important thing is it is not going to be life-threatening to JPMorgan and it will be years before we know the ultimate outcome.
JAMIE DIMON: I really -- Betsy, I did not check, but they have to come down because the originations have come down and I just didn't look at the pipeline. I would be surprised if there were $50 billion of closed loans this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I would think so, yes, because, remember, that stuff usually is like 60 days and the last month was pretty low.
JAMIE DIMON: Are you referring to -- are you referring to any particular segment here?
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. So the Commercial Bank loans have been up middle-market -- other loans -- remember, we also bought a portfolio. The middle-market has been up every quarter the last three or four quarters, not because of utilization, just more loans and we think that is a very good thing. It could be a little bit of marketshare, but I anecdotally hear from other people that there is loan growth there too. So our early indicators are that we will continue to see loan growth this year and early indicators are people requesting it and industrial production and inventory numbers and all the things which could drive kind of loan demand. In credit card, yes, there is going to be a seasonal drop in the first quarter. And I have got the number -- that is always going to be 4% or 5%. Plus, for us, you have got $3 billion of run-off. So the drop could be something like $10 billion in the first quarter. By the third -- so the run-off is a couple billion dollars a quarter after that, but underlying that, we are actually seeing some growth now. So you might actually see net growth by the fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, the rules haven't all been finished yet, but we are obviously preparing -- we are going to be a great derivative house, okay? So if you want to go through us and go to a clearinghouse, we will be prepared -and it is possible volumes will go up. So we gave you guys a number, like a $1 billion loss potential revenue, but we don't really know. We have seen a lot of things that go to clearinghouses, volumes go up, spreads can change a little bit, but it might be a net plus. But you could assume that we are building rapidly to make sure we are the best out there in the new world.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, that's a very good point, but it is one of the reasons there are issues about exchanges where you, in effect, socialize the credit -- you socialize both credits. You socialize the credit of the company that might have been providing credit and the credit of the company getting credit. So that is why we look at that -- that piece of it will be a possible small negative. But we don't know how it is all going to sort out. Like we are not quite sure what the margin rules will be for end-user exemptions and we will see. Remember, a lot of the end-user exemptions, the reason they want to do business with JPMorgan is we will give them the benefit of their credit and they get the benefit of our credit as opposed to an exchange where neither happens.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me make just a statement about Durbin. Part of what happened in Durbin was this notion that retailers pay zero for cash and zero for checks and they were paying 70 to 80 basis points per debit card. Well, the fact is cash costs retailers and there are a lot of studies done on this, 30 to 70 basis points. They have got to process it, handle it, move it, insure it, bank it. They need registers and there is a lot of defalcation. What is that called when -- checks cost also 70 basis points for all the same basic reasons. So debit was just -- as a matter of fact, a guaranteed check, which is the equivalent to a debit, like get your money right away and it is guaranteed, you are not taking the fraud or credit risk, is $1.20, 1.2% if you want to go guarantee a check. So that was a false premise. The other false premise is that somehow, in a fixed cost business, you can price variable cost and survive. No business in the world can price its product at variable cost and survive. And so this debit thing had an enormous benefit for consumers. Even for retailers, it was faster and how this happens is completely beyond us and we have to figure it out. You can't price your products at variable cost and survive as a business. So we are going to have to figure out a way and we want to do it as consumer-friendly and fair, but, of course, the consumer has got to pay and they weren't paying for debit before. So we don't exactly know. We are going to test a whole bunch of things. Remember, we might just charge for checking, you might charge for debit, you might just have higher deposit balances and you are right, you might keep a little bit more spread. So that is all going to sort out both in the competitive sense and a legal sense as we figure out how to deal with it. But our biggest concern right now is to do it in a way that is as consumer-friendly as possible. We also think it will have the adverse consequences of making a portion of current bank clients unbanked. You will not be able to profitably serve them. And my current estimate would be about 5% and I am not sure that was a good public policy issue either.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the general banking customer base may be pushed out of the banking system.
JAMIE DIMON: It is largely for private label mortgage and mortgage-related type of stuff. Foreclosure settlement -- we don't have any foreclosure settlement, but there was hundreds of millions of dollars of higher costs that we kind of either expensed or accrued for the delay in foreclosures for the affidavit issue.
JAMIE DIMON: No, you read it right. And that number, obviously, when normalized, would go back to a -- the non-comp number, go back to more normalized, 1.6 or 1.7 a quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: No, a whole bunch of stuff. The detritus of the storm.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so remember the credit portfolio -- it's a hard one but it, on a normalized basis, should earn about $200 million or $300 million a quarter. And think of that as NII. But in addition to that there is hedging and hedges and up or down, so it swings all over the place. We try to manage that economically, not for steady GAAP revenue.
JAMIE DIMON: You are right; most of that -- I think the largest part of that is just from dropping more volatile quarters from last year.
JAMIE DIMON: So that number is coming down for no reason other than you are changing the data set that goes into the calculation, which is one of the reasons I personally never paid that much attention to it, because it changes without any good reason. It is not -- there was no conscious effort to take down risk, etc., and that is done by desk, and I don't think there was any particular area where it was dramatically different than others. There are a couple that are coming down, but it is usually the trader is making decisions on that particular book.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, and we also realized $1 billion of gains.
JAMIE DIMON: We also realized $1 billion of gains. It's the realized gains that reduces the AOCI because that would have been there. And remember, we did that early and we are doing that to protect -- not just protect the AOCI, but if you look at our interest rate exposures, we are positively -- if rates, long rates go up, it will help us and if short rates go up, it will help us a teeny bit. So we've positioned the Company for raising rates and I think we did it a little bit early, saving (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we had settled most the GSE stuff -- the GSE putback rep and warranty issue had already been settled regarding WaMu. That had been done some time -- a year ago or something.
JAMIE DIMON: It is kind of a moot point, but if they wanted to settle it all at once, it would be fine with us.
JAMIE DIMON: It is getting more and more developed. The loss curves are getting more developed. They know their own numbers. We know their numbers look, both Fannie and Freddie are working with us, giving us files, we look at the files, we turn them back, we're just trying to all get it behind.
JAMIE DIMON: We think they are and (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: Well, that's a different issue. There is a whole bunch of stuff (inaudible) WaMu to settle and finalize all the stuff. Then there is the private label. WaMu is about a third of the private label. We think that they are responsible for that piece. Again, the analysts, you all have done estimates on this and between our reserves and even some of your estimates, it's going to take a long time to resolve. And so my attitude is it is going to be resolved, it may be more, it may be less, but it is not going to be terrible for us whether or not WaMu takes their one-third.
JAMIE DIMON: It is behind us, but the big piece is, and now it is going to go on for years. I don't think this stuff will be -- we'll be talking about this every quarter for the next three years.
JAMIE DIMON: I hope that people get more and more comfortable that while we are talking about it, it isn't like something that is going to change the future of JPMorgan. It is just going to be a few adjustments in a few quarters up or down when this is all resolved.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say it is similar and higher unemployment, home prices going down and we do this ourselves anyway by the way and stress testing market results and stuff like that. But a lot more detail. I mean a tremendous amount more detail and in any event, even under highly stressed environments, JPMorgan is going to be retaining an awful lot of capital. We are looking for ways to use that capital. (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: Yes and whether they come up with similar numbers or not, I don't know, but the fact is we are going to have plenty of capital and we also think that 7% Basel III is plenty of capital. In fact, I think the stress tests will confirm that. Not just on us, on all the banks. That is what capital is for, to deal with stress and for the most part, I think banks will be able to deal with a lot of stress at 7% Basel III. I mean we are starting to add capital on top of capital at this point.
JAMIE DIMON: And I remind you of the Basel -- 7% Basel III is more akin to 11% Basel I. The first stress test on Basel I was 4%.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think the regulators are looking at the issues and this is a world, global issue because a lot of regulators overseas think there should be a lot more and some think it is sufficient. And I hope America takes a rational position and a leadership position. That is what I hope. We don't have to do what everyone overseas thinks should be done. We should take a leadership position in the United States what we think is appropriate and I personally -- I think 7% is plenty. I think you could make many arguments why some of the big companies were stabilizers in the storm as opposed to systemic risks in the storm.
JAMIE DIMON: We had disclosed at one point that our net exposures were $20 billion in the GIPSI countries. That number is down substantially now, but the important part is that we also continue to do business there with sovereigns, with Corporates, with governments, with institutions because we have a lot of clients. And so we are letting the client side do that and obviously those exposures could come back and haunt us at one point, but we are not going to stop doing business in those countries. So the business is just down a little bit. I don't think there is any mystery to it and are there opportunities we get from it? Yes, I think the opportunities come from continuing to service our clients, not running. That is the real opportunity, that people know you are there for the client in good times and bad times.
JAMIE DIMON: I wouldn't count on something like that. We believe the highest use that we can ever do is organic growth. And if something came up that really made a tremendous amount of sense, (inaudible) our obligation to go look about it and think about it, but I am not sure that will happen.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, are you talking about for us or for the system?
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, we are going to continue to do business in all those countries. We have clients in all those countries. They rely on us, we want to be there for them. We are not a fair weather friend and could we lose money from that? Absolutely. We could be making a mistake, but that will be okay. We are supposed to be there for them in good times and bad times. I personally think that Europe will muddle through this situation. They have demonstrated, and I think the regulators and the leaders have demonstrated that they are going to fix this. It is a little bit of stop and starts. A little -- obviously there is some disagreements, but you have seen a lot of very strong statements that they are going to get through this. And I would bet on that. I think that is the likely outcome. Now we are not betting the Company, but I do think that is the likely outcome. I do think over time they have got some serious structural issues they have to fix.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think Europe had any effect on TSS at all. I know we did much better in trade finance -- did better in trade finance.
JAMIE DIMON: I feel pretty good about where it is right now.
JAMIE DIMON: And we like to keep our balance sheet clean and just move on so we have moved on.
JAMIE DIMON: I would just like to make a comment about litigation because I did mention before about the detritus of the storm. I think it is also reasonable that after you have had a storm like this, like the litigation follows years later, so I am not saying there won't be other litigation. My experience has been that things will, and you have seen tons of it. Some of it is completely frivolous, but some may not be and so I can't say there won't be any litigation expense next year of size.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess we have normal business growth in 2011, which will use some of the balance sheet and we are still waiting for final guidance from the regulators on what the capital requirements are going to be, etc. But listen, we can build the balance sheet much quicker if and when we feel it is appropriate.
JAMIE DIMON: We always have -- we could always make a portfolio decision to put assets on the balance sheet to create more NII. That is why I always talk about excess capital is earnings in store. You can use it whenever you want, just use it wisely and use it at the right time. We don't want to do that and have huge unrealized losses. We are actually trying to protect ourselves from that.
JAMIE DIMON: They have said that when they finish all this work, which will be -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: Late March, March 21.
JAMIE DIMON: Late March, that they will be giving companies guidance on capital. So that capital to me is dividends and stock buyback. And at that point in time, and if we have a little more guidance on the ultimate outcome of what the capital needs to be, like it is going to be more than 7%, our Board will take the appropriate action. I hope we will be able to institute a dividend right away.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, it's just due to a large asset moved to nonperforming and remember, nonperforming has specific reserves against it, so we are not worried about that at all.
JAMIE DIMON: We noticed that.
JAMIE DIMON: You mean how trading is doing so far this month, is that what you're saying?
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know. You guys can guess as much as we can. So far, the year has started off pretty good and look, you can have a very good year in trading in Investment Banking this year, but your guess is as good as my guess, so use your own.
JAMIE DIMON: Why don't we just wait and get the guidance from the Fed about what it is going to be? What we have spoken about is that we would like to get to eventually back to 35% of normalized earnings. If the Fed gives guidance that they wanted to be at 30% of normalized earnings, then we have to limit it to 30% of normalized earnings. They are our regulators and remember me, I prefer don't pay dividends at all so we can use it for some other purpose down the road.
JAMIE DIMON: Again, I would defer that. The treasury is putting out some guidance on the GSEs. If you change servicing, that changes how you price mortgages and how you account for mortgages. So it is not going to change the mortgage business per se. You are still going to originate and service mortgages. It will just change the asset on the balance sheet and accounting. So I am not worried about it. I would just prefer to wait to see all the guidance that comes out from the government and how it all sorts out.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but it is still under -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: It doesn't have a big impact on our Basel III capital.
JAMIE DIMON: Because it counts up to 10% or 15% -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: 10% and 15% in total for a number of items and we are not very far off that.
JAMIE DIMON: And basically we would probably restrict MSR to 10% of the balance sheet if that were the case unless it was really, really profitable in which case, we will take the capital charge and put it back on.
JAMIE DIMON: That was across the board.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think it is investment spend. I think it is just -- the way you should look at it, these expense will grow with our businesses over time. I don't think we have massive additional expense we are adding in addition to that. There are a lot of expense, which will eventually go away. You mentioned -- there was a little over $300 million from the affidavit thing this quarter. There is $300 million of foreclosure expense. There is -obviously a lot of the mortgage charge-offs will reduce dramatically over time, but it is not through expense and there was obviously the litigation stuff, which hopefully won't be re-occurring. But I look at it by business. It is very hard for me to look at the aggregate.
JAMIE DIMON: So some of that was moved to what I would call spread product, which has the exact effect of what you're saying, but it protects you in a rising rate environment. And so -- which we thought was a wise thing to do. That portfolio is used to both reinvest excess deposits and to balance all the asset liability management of the Company and right now, we are asset-sensitive. We just think that is the right place to be. Can we change it and reduce the size of that portfolio? Absolutely. But those are portfolio -- big portfolio decisions, which we try to make at the appropriate time. And you really can't look at it relating to the long-term debt. I mean the long-term debt is -- a lot of it is swapped and a lot of the assets are also swapped.
JAMIE DIMON: We have -- I'm at $23 billion of turns this year.
JAMIE DIMON: Depending -- right now, we are playing for kind of good organic growth and we don't know the capital rules. It is possible, when all that comes out, we may not issue all that debt. It is possible that we will do other things with the balance sheet and figure out how to -- but all of it will be done to protect the Company and to make good money for the shareholder.
JAMIE DIMON: I am not going to give you a specific legal (inaudible). Every state is different and the facts of these things are different and we said right from the beginning, you are going to see a lot of state differences, local differences, court differences and we have kind of built that into our thinking.
JAMIE DIMON: There might be, but I hope -- but it would be the same kind of thing is how do you finish and properly process foreclosures. And I don't think this one thing changes the mess. It is a big mess, it has cost us a lot of money. I personally think we are well along the way, we are more through this whole thing and unfortunately, the only way to do it right is name by name by name. There is almost no other way to do it properly. Person by person, home by home, are they occupied, did they lie on their forms, are they entitled to a HAMP, are they entitled to a modification. We will do as many as we can. There is a lot of paperwork. The paperwork is different in every single state. There are mistakes made and I remind people the affidavit process was not the foreclosure process. There were multiple checks and balances and there may be mistakes made in the foreclosure process, but they are very few and boy, when we find them, we try to make up for them right away. And obviously, as this issue has been heavily politicized and in some cases mistakes were made and they are being pointed out and they should be fixed.
JAMIE DIMON: US -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: US -JAMIE DIMON: I missed it, so I don't -- do you know the answer, Doug?
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know the opt-in percentage. Do you remember it?
JAMIE DIMON: Right. And the full run rate effective, that is already in the number.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. And then on the Durbin thing, you have to -- you can't run your business where you are charging things at variable cost. So in some ways, we are going to have to look at ways of repricing the business and that may not come from a price you see, it may just come from higher -- you have to keep higher deposits on balance to have reduced fees. It may come from checking account fees. You have already seen a lot of people around the country eliminate free checking. But I think ultimately, ultimately, most of that will get repriced into the business. It is very hard to run a business where you can't charge for your products.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but it will take time (multiple speakers) and we are very conscious of doing it right. Like design the right products for the right people, it may drive -- like I said before, it may drive some clients out of the business into the non-banks because there may be no way to reprice those clients since you can't collect other fees. Maybe the accounts are too small and remember, for a whole bunch of clients, it may not matter that much at all. They already have high balances. They are already quite profitable. So we will have to figure it out and we are doing a lot of thinking and a lot of testing. So remember, it is effective July, so we still have a little time to figure it all out.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I would -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: I would think of it more as just a run rate going forward.
JAMIE DIMON: Just as run rate normal and customers are going to get careful how they do things. So we are not looking for it as a growth item, it is just another item on the income statement.
JAMIE DIMON: Some of it we sold and got rid of and reduced, but I don't know if there was any particular -- it wasn't real estate particularly.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't remember. We periodically do that to keep it clean and move on. I would say, when we have been doing it, it has been economic to do so. So in large part, the reduction in NPLs were either reserved for or actually got some recoveries as a result of that.
JAMIE DIMON: We are economic analysts. We don't do that to show lower numbers. We do that because we think it is the right thing to do to manage our credit portfolio economically.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think it is structural and I don't think it is an overhang of euro concerns either. I think it is just the ebbs and flows of trading. Rates were very strong early in the year and I know came down a little bit. The last couple of weeks in December are almost always low. Credit has been very strong all year and I think it was a little slower this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: So it is just -- trading changes. That is the way it is. But I don't think it is either structural or Europe.
JAMIE DIMON: So far this year, it has started off pretty good.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. I think the first answer is I think we had a -- I am not going to call it artificial, we had a bump-up in '09, which I think we told our shareholders we expected to come down a little bit in 2010 because the competition has come back full force, which I think is a good thing, so I am not -- we knew it was going to happen, but it happened. So I think that is part of it. Over time, we have kind of gained share and then there are some other areas, equity, a lot more done in China, A shares, which we can't do that we just got licensed to do it, M&A. A couple of the deals we had didn't happen. But we are comfortable with our franchise. We think we have a fabulous Investment Banking franchise and we will defend it.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, we feel like we have a lot of liquidity. I know Edward is showing his liquidity ratios, these new liquidity numbers, but I am not sure they are all equally done nor are all businesses the same. So if you had a big retail business, you may not feel the need for that. If you had a big wholesale funded business, you might feel the need for a lot more of that. So we feel fine where we are. If we wanted to drive that number up, we can easily do that at no cost to the Company. But I am not sure why that would help us. And the other thing I look at, which is important, is if you look at our balance sheet, there is a $300 billion portfolio, mostly very high-quality stuff. There is a lot of short-term assets, repo and we have, what is it, a $1 trillion of deposits and $700 billion of loans. And we look at that as a very stable funding source. And that is true in almost every single business. The deposits are far in excess of loans. That is even true in middle-market.
JAMIE DIMON: And we just -- I just saw your report that came out and between capital and these LCR ratios, the LCR hasn't all been issued -- isn't all finished either, but there are some serious issues about how they look at certain types of deposits and certain types of revolvers.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the way you should look at -- I think we have built a world-class trading business. I think if you go back several years ago, that wasn't completely true. We had extremely volatile results. We weren't as strong in a lot of areas. Now we are strong in a lot of different -- we have always had some historical strengths. We are still building the commodity side, which we are going to continue to build. And if you look at shares, like if you look at Greenwich Reports and other people report shares, our shares have gone up dramatically in trading. I'm talking about over years now. I am not talking about over quarters.
JAMIE DIMON: Does that answer your question?
JAMIE DIMON: Again, we are purely economic, so we are not going to sell something just to sell it and sell at low cost, but sometimes you think it is worth X, the buyer thinks it is worth a little bit more than X, sometimes they are better able to handle it. They are more local, they are more capable, etc. So I wouldn't read anything into that other than it is the normal pruning of what we do and how we look at our exposures. And I don't think it had any material effect on the numbers this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. But not materially.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I think there is a little bit more risk appetite over -- as the year progresses, there was more risk appetite for people to take on things like that.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, well, our folks are working hard. I mean if you have questions, and stuff you want answered, just send them into Lauren, but you are going to hear from every business and we will talk about the future of the growth opportunities. We will have obviously balance sheet returns, targets. We are going to try to cover the whole shebang for you and we feel great about the Company. If you look at the underlying results here, we are growing, we have got a lot of businesses, they are all doing quite well. They have done well through this crisis. We never stop making money, we never stop investing, we never stop marketing, we never stop helping clients around the world. So this Company -- I think the future is extremely bright and in spite of all the headwinds. I think if you are an owner of bank stocks, you can make a long, long list of all kinds of things hanging over banks, regulatory Basel and I think there is some truth to that. But also during the course (inaudible), some of those things will be resolved and we will go on. They may have negative effects, positive effect and there are always unintended consequences, but there is a chance some of those will be positive too.
JAMIE DIMON: Folks, thank you very much for spending some time with us and we will be talking to you soon.",0.13000000000000012,-0.21700000000000014,0,0.095353602872893,0.1285081388264208
3,Q1_2018,"
MARIANNE LAKE, EXECUTIVE VP & CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Just to let you know that Jamie is actually on the road with clients today, so he's not able to join us this morning, but sends his regards. So now, I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.7 billion, EPS of $2.37 and a return on tangible common equity of 19% on revenue of $28.5 billion benefiting from broad-based strength and performance, but also lower taxes and seasonality. To put this quarter's performance in its context, on a core basis, pretax earnings grew $0.13 year-on-year, benefiting from higher rates, solid growth across other revenue drivers and continued investments in our businesses. And even excluding the benefit of tax reforms, net income was a clear record this quarter. Included in the results you see on the page approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. These gains are reported in CIB Markets revenue. Against that, there were a number of other smaller, but nevertheless notable items, including changes in credit reserves, FDA, investment securities and private equity losses and legal, which, together, substantially offset those gains. Underlying results continued to be strong. Average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 8% year-on-year, Card sales and Merchant processing volumes, up 12% and 15%, respectively. We maintained our #1 rank in Global IB fees and had net income of $1 billion in the Commercial Bank. And in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw strong long-term flows across all regions and 10% AUM growth. Turning to Page 2, some more details about the first quarter results. So before we get into the numbers and the performance drivers for the quarter, I do want to remind you that there have been a couple of adjustments to the numbers on the page, which are in line with the guidance that we gave during the fourth quarter. First being the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. You will recall this will have a full year impact of grossing up noninterest revenue and expense, each by approximately $1.2 billion. The impact for the quarter of about $300 million is included here and prior periods have been similarly restated. Second, as a result of tax reform, certain tax equivalent adjustments that are included in managed revenue are lower on a relative basis, and for that, prior periods have not been restated. This impact, which was also about $300 million for the quarter, reduced revenues, was split about 50-50 in NII versus NIR and offset in tax expense. So with that, revenue of $28.5 billion was up $2.7 billion or 10% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates. Noninterest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year, and while it includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately of $400 million of losses on investment securities and legacy private equity investments. Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including auto lease depreciation. Credit costs of $1.2 billion were down $150 million year-on-year. Consumer charge-offs were in line with expectations and guidance and there were no changes to reserves this quarter. In Wholesale, we had a net reserve release of about $170 million driven by a single Oil & Gas name. You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pretax earnings as well as geographical mix, reflecting full year effective tax rate to be close to 20%. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the first quarter with CET1 of 11.8%, down about 30 basis points versus last quarter. Capital generated was offset by net capital distribution and changes in AOCI, so the reduction was driven by higher risk-weighted assets reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios. In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders, and last week, we submitted our 2018 CCAR capital plan to the Federal Reserve, but as you know, we can't provide any details of that at this stage. So before moving onto the lines of business on Page 4, I'll briefly address this week's new capital news. Two new capital NPRs were released this week, the stress capital buffer and eSLR. Starting with the stress capital buffer, the proposal was broadly in line with the narrative and expectations that had been set. There's a comment period. We intend to fully participate in the process and are encouraged that there is an openness from current leadership to really consider feedback from the industry. On the positive side, we support the conversion of stress and BAU capital, and in general, support simplification of the framework. We agree that firms should be required to hold adequate capital to withstand severe stress calibrated to firms' specific exposures and risks. We also agree that many of the changes to the construct of the test, for example, not having to hold capital for full distributions during a stressed environment, that can reflect reality and board-approved policies. That said, stepping right back, if we are fundamentally reconsidering the construct of minimum capital levels, then all of the building blocks should be in play, including the GSIB surcharge, to ensure they all hang together. And to reinforce points that we've previously made, first and foremost, the fixed coefficients need to be recalibrated in light of the economic growth we've had. Second, the underlying premise for the surcharge and, more particularly, U.S. gold-plating is somewhat unnecessary for a firm that is compliant with all of the post-crisis reform that directly addresses systemic risks, which includes the severity of the CCAR stress, incorporating material GSIB specific instructions. Beyond that, obvious challenges with the current proposal include the significant volatility and the opacity in the Fed's results as well as challenges around implementation. So getting to the numbers. You can see on the page our estimated historical stress capital buffer derived from the Fed's results. As well, for 2017, it would imply no impact on our minimum capital levels. You can see that in years prior, the buffer would have been higher. And you know that in 2018, the scenario was, in many ways, more severe and the lower tax rate has a net negative bias. Further, there will potentially be a need for larger management buffers if it is necessary to accommodate significant volatility. So acknowledging everything that we don't know, it's fair to say that our minimum level of capital including a management buffer would likely be higher under this proposal, but likely still in the range of 11% to 12%. Briefly on eSLR. As you know, we are not currently bound by leverage, and prima facie, this proposal would reduce the eSLR minimum. So my primary comment on this is to reiterate my earlier comments about the need to be willing to re-examine the GSIB surcharge regardless of the fact that it reduces the number. Overall, we've been waiting for these proposals and we look forward to participating in the comment process. Moving to Page 5 and let's start with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $3.3 billion of net income and an ROE of 25%. Core loans are up 8% year-on-year driven by Home Lending, up 13%; Business Banking, up 7%; Cards, up 5%; and auto loans and leases, up 6%. Deposits grew solidly at 6% year-on-year. We believe we continue to outpace the industry, which, as we previously noted, is experiencing a slowdown as consumers are increasing their allocations to investments, but also, based upon our data, they appear to be spending more reflecting a continued high level of confidence. Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter. And active mobile users were up double digits. Revenue of $12.6 billion was up 15% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was roughly flat as portfolio loan spread and production margin compression were predominantly offset by higher net servicing revenue. And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 18%, including higher auto lease income, but it was driven by Card on lower net acquisition costs, higher loan balances as well as margin expansion. The Card revenue rate was 11.6% in the quarter. Expense of $6.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by investments in technology and marketing, higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth. The overhead ratio of 55% was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite seasonally higher payroll taxes and higher marketing expenses. Finally, on credit. The trends across our portfolio remain favorable. Charge-offs were driven by Card and were in line with guidance, and there were no reserve actions taken this quarter. Recall last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale. Turning to Page 6 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion and an ROE of 22%. This quarter in Banking, we maintained our #1 ranking in Global IB fees as well as our #1 rank in North America and EMEA. IB fees were $1.7 billion, down 10% to a record quarter last year, and strong performance in M&A was more than offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees. Advisory fees were up 15% year-on-year as we saw good momentum and some large deals closed. We ranked #1 in global M&A wallet and gained share in every region, and for the quarter, we announced and completed more deals than any other bank. Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals. This quarter, we ranked #3 in a very competitive environment. And debt underwriting fees were down 18%, driven by a slow start to the year, primarily due to increased market volatility, which reduced issuance. Despite these headwinds, we maintained our #1 ranking globally, and looking forward to the rest of the year, across products, the overall pipeline remains strong. Moving onto Markets. Total Markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 13% year-on-year reported. However, as mentioned, this includes the mark-to-market gains we called out on the front page and also includes a reduction of about $150 million reflecting lower tax equivalent adjustments year-on-year. Accounting for both of these items, Markets revenues would have been up about 7%. Fixed Income Markets adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year with rates and spread markets reversing to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance. It was a record quarter for equities and revenue was up 25%, a well-diversified story driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter with increased volatility benefiting all of equity derivatives. In addition, we saw share gains in cash and continued client activity driving growth in prime as the investments that we'd made in the business are paying off. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16%, respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. Securities Services also benefited from asset-based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity. Finally, expense of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, half being higher compensation expense with a comp-to-revenue ratio of 29% and the remainder primarily driven by higher transaction costs in Markets. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7. Another very good quarter in this business with net income of $1 billion and ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year driven by higher deposit NII as we continued to benefit from higher rates, partially offset by lower IB revenue. Sequentially, revenue was down 8% largely driven by the impact of tax reform. Gross IB revenue of $569 million was down 15% year-on-year on a lower overall industry wallet and fewer large transactions versus last year. That said, the underlying flow of business remains robust. In fact, it was a record quarter for Middle Markets clients, and the pipeline looks strong. Expense of $844 million was up year-on-year as we continued to invest in the business both in bankers and technology. Loan balances were up 6% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 5% on strength in our expansion markets as well as specialized industries, but down 1% sequentially, roughly in line with the industry. CRE loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter as the competition is significantly elevated. So both while client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline. Finally, credit performance continued to be very good with 0 net charge-offs this quarter. Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $770 million with a pretax margin of 26% and an ROE of 34%. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposit margin expansion and loan growth. Expense of $2.6 billion was down year-on-year as the first quarter of last year included nearly $400 million of legal expense. Adjusted, expense would have been up 8% driven by higher external fees on revenue as well as higher compensation. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion, including $5 billion in active equities, with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance. We saw net liquidity outflows of $21 billion, largely driven by a combination of recent M&A activity and the impact of cash repatriation due to tax reform. AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 10% and 9%, respectively, on higher market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting the migration into investments, which we previously discussed, but were about flat sequentially on seasonally higher balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 12% with strength in both mortgage as well as other loans globally. Moving to Page 9 on Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $383 million. The net loss of $187 million in Treasury and CIO was primarily due to losses related to securities sales. The net loss of $196 million in Other Corporate reflects approximately $100 million after-tax loss on legacy private equity investments as well as a net tax expense on adjustments and true-ups to certain reserves. And you'll recall that last year included a legal benefit and last quarter, of course, included the impact of tax reform. Finally, turning to Page 10 and the outlook. Given Investor Day is only 6 weeks behind us, we've not changed our guidance for the full year of 2018. So to wrap up, we are pleased with the firm's performance this quarter with all of our businesses showing continued and broad strength in an overall environment that remains supportive. And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into top line growth and positive operating leverage with revenues and pretax income both up double digits year-on-year. So with that, operator, we can take some questions. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Okay, so I'll just -- I'll sort of end with the upshot, which is that net-net, the impact to our results in the quarter was a very modest positive, So a pretty small number, but on the positive direction. And we've actually seen this a little bit before, I can't remember, a year or so ago. We are more sensitive, as you know, to the front end of rates, but principally to IOER and prime. So while we do have exposure to LIBOR repricing, it's both on the asset and liability side, as you mentioned, and we also have exposure, a combination of 1 year -- 1-month and 3-month LIBOR. So if you look sort of net across the assets and liabilities side, they materially offset. We don't have sort of significant mismatches. And so as a consequence, obviously, we benefit from a higher level of absolute short rates, but the basis widening hasn't been very meaningful to our NII. And I mean examples of assets that reprice off LIBOR would be the Commercial Banking loans and obviously, unhedged -- or hedged fixed -- hedged long-term debt, sorry, on the liability side.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So let's start with sort of 3 relatively big drivers. So yes, as we have now sort of lapped the big Sapphire Reserve, high-premium vintages, our net acquisition costs are substantially lower and so that is a tailwind. Plus, we are seeing regular way BAU growth in the Card NIR sort of drivers. Similarly, Markets, as we talked about, after the first quarter performance, that's a driver. And then there's the ongoing sort of growth in the auto lease income space, which is significant. Outside of that, you look at our underlying drivers across the board in terms of new accounts and debit trends and card sales and asset management fees as a driver, too. So there's obviously a level of market dependency to it, but a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the somewhat tailwind of Card and Markets, both in the trading and in the asset management space.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I'd start with year-over-year, we're still getting significant benefit from our investment in expansion markets and also, as you know, we had a pretty -- we have a pretty unique sort of offering in terms of [commercial] term lending. And so for a period of time, in both of those spaces, we've been materially outperforming the market and so we're still seeing the benefit of that in our year-over-year numbers. Quarter-over-quarter -- and the trouble with C&I loans is there can also be volatility associated with held-for-sale mortgage portfolio seasonality -- sorry, mortgage warehouse seasonality and stuff like that. But quarter-over-quarter, what we're seeing is just the impact of the sort of overall industry-wide slowdown and the fact that, you're right, it's not just pricing, it's just generally we continue to be very selective and cautious given where we are in the cycle. But we're not expecting flat for the year; we're expecting growth in the mid-single digits for the year and we still believe that there should be demand. And in the CTL space and commercial real estate more generally, that's where the competition really has stepped up very significantly and that where -- that really is where pricing has become fiercely competitive and there's been compression.
MARIANNE LAKE: I mean, so generally, across the sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer the question is yes. But remember, for us, that we haven't been constrained by leverage, Tier 1 leverage, or SLR over the last several years and it's a result, obviously, of the business mix we have and operating model that we have that we can socialize some of our scarcest resources across the company. And so we wouldn't expect that our behaviors have changed materially.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I'll give you my best thoughts. I would say it's a little bit more structural than it is seasonal and we've been seeing continued growth in both digital and especially the mobile channels and it's a lot to do with adding features, and as we talked about at Investor Day, making it compelling for people to digitally move money, which makes them become much more engaged and all of the good things that come with that. In addition, we talked also I think at Investor Day about the fact that we've recently added digital account opening. And so I couldn't give you exact amounts of what is driving -- which ones of those is driving what, but we would continue to expect a bit of a structural acceleration, certainly we hope for it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I think we sort of talked about the fact that digitally engaged customers are more loyal, that they spend more and they bring us more deposits and investments. So we gave you the stats I think at Investor Day, we see more card spend, both debit and credit, but we also see higher deposits and investments for digitally active customers. So overall, it's really good for our franchise to have these customers engaged and we hope they also use our branches, by the way. With respect to deposit betas, we've talked before about the 2 theses. The first, which is the one that we generally subscribe to, is that a combination of the ability to use technology, the transparency and expectation of higher rates as well as potentially, over time, the value of retail deposits liquidity, that we would expect higher reprice. And we haven't changed our expectation on that, but we haven't seen it yet either. So we're going to have to watch that movie play out. There is the other side of that argument that other people, many people subscribe to, which is the customer experience investments, the convenience, the brand, the marketing, the digital features, the products and services, the rewards all become increasingly important and customers are less price-sensitive. So I guess we'll all know it when it finally unfolds. As you know, we sort of take a little bit more of a conservative view, but where we are right now in the normalization cycle specifically, for sort of the retail checking and savings, is we haven't yet seen that unfold. We have seen migration in Asset Wealth Management balances and that's to be expected to be a leading indicator. So this will unfold over the course of the next year or so.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm sorry, say that again?
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So we've seen 2 things happen, I guess. We've seen -- obviously, we've rolled forward a quarter. I think, our earnings-at-risk disclosed at the end of last quarter was $1.7 billion [evolved] for the quarter and that comes down a little as we sort of realized the rate benefit, but we've also seen, as you know, somewhere in the sort of mid-40s basis point increase in rates as the sort of front and long end, which would also have a somewhat significant impact. So $1.7 billion will be down quite meaningfully, I would expect, at the end of the first quarter, but you'll those disclosures in our Q.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I think it's extremely difficult to draw a straight line between VaR and all its complexities and revenues in any one quarter. And if I just sort of unpick it for you first -- and by the way, just to reiterate that it's still at relatively low levels relative to historical norms when we've been in more normal trading environments with higher levels of volatility and inventory and the like. So I would just unpick it and say of the increase, more than half was related to volatility and obviously, some of the volatility was somewhat significant. We wouldn't necessarily expect to see that level continue, albeit that we would expect to continue to see periods or episodes of significant volatility. And a bit less than half has to do with positions principally, but not exclusively as a result of higher levels of client activity in the CIB and you saw the balance sheet also go up and risk-weighted assets and so on.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I mean, I would start a little bit with -- so when you say as written, if you take the last year's spot -- stress capital buffer, you've seen just from history for us that, that could be significant. So there are 3 observations I have. The first is when we think about capital planning, I think rightly, you would expect us and we do think about it over more than a 1-year cycle. And while we have very significant earnings capacity, we don't want to be sort of up and down and sideways and find ourselves sideways. So I think there will be some implications of the potential for volatility in the calibration of management buffers. And so whether it's in a higher or lower SEB or whether it has to be taken into consideration so that we aren't caught sideways for the test result that is, with respect, once a year and a little bit opaque. The second thing I would highlight to you is for what it's worth, you saw our Investor Day sort of I won't say guidance, but sort of indication that we would expect to try and have payouts at or around 100%, say, plus or minus and you see our ratios are a little bit below 12%. So I think that puts us on reasonably solid footing regardless of the precision of it to sort of understand how the rules play out. Finally, I hope and I believe, I suspect, that through the comment period, the implications of volatility will be properly explored and that hopefully, there will be some sort of mechanism considered to accommodate, smooth or otherwise allow for things not to be whipsawed around based upon the specificity of the test. And the margin, I guess, the fourth point, but it's not something that we overthink is having the four quarters of dividend explicitly included notwithstanding that the (inaudible) is lifted kind of makes it dollar-for-dollar capital. So at the margin, I guess that makes people think carefully, but we would still want to pay out a strong healthy dividend on growing earnings.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean, that's definitely one of the factors. But just the other sort of slightly cruder first-order factor is we are running 70 basis points above our minimum. So if you reduce the minimum by another 100 or 200 basis points, whatever the number is, we already had excess capacity. And so when we think about the use of our resources, we obviously think about let's maximize SBA and so we haven't felt extraordinarily constrained, I would say. So there's that kind of just sort of basic we haven't been maybe as constrained as maybe others have been and that is what it is. And so while we'll continue to make every decision incrementally based upon marginal SBA, but you are right, you have to take into consideration all the knock-on impacts. I mean, our stock price alone impacts GSIB.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, I would say that in the Fixed Income space, it was a sort of discussion and it was a feature or a factor; and even in Equities, to be honest, that it was part of the discussion. But I wouldn't say that we could point to it materially impacting our trading results.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So think about -- so many of these investments are years old, many years old and think about them as strategic investments that relate to business activity, for example, illustratively, like in financial market infrastructures or clearinghouses or exchanges or so on, also some strategic investments potentially related to other parts of the business. So it just happens to be the case that those investments years ago relate and continue to relate to Fixed Income more than Equities and they were previously held at cost. And as there are observable prices, as you know, this quarter, we have to reflect that. So it's really the nature of the investment.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I would say across the board actually, all the way from small business through Middle Market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings, more free cash flow and, generally speaking, that would improve the sort of credit quality of the portfolio. And we will only really see that come through as we get financials and see that in the financials and are able to reflect that in our internal ratings. But we would expect to see some positive lift as a result of that over time. So no doubt it helps, but it helps in a rising rate environment so there's a lot of stuff is a minus, it's a yes. It's a tailwind for credit overall.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we could. What it is actually is the tax equivalent adjustments that I mentioned. So you're seeing the sort of relative impact of sort of lower tax gross-ups in our muni portfolio, in investment securities. If you were to adjust to that, they would have been up in line with rates.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say we still feel really good about the Consumer, I mean really good. And so while you can look at the sort of overall sort of levels of Consumer indebtedness and look at the fact that they've reached a peak and Student Lending is driving that in a large part, it's also clearly the case that people have had a long time to repair their balance sheet and term out debt at low rates and become more liquid and so sort of debt service burdens are still manageable. And so over -- and confidence is high and perhaps should be a benefit, generally speaking. So overall, we still feel pretty good and it's showing a little bit in our sort of consumer spend data where we're seeing that confidence continue to sort of spur a bit in spending. With respect to reserves -- so our expectation and our belief about the strength of Consumer continues to be optimistic. And then further, of course, you know that our portfolio particularly is skewed towards higher-quality credit and so we aren't seeing any signs of fragility or deterioration across the portfolio across the board. So we feel pretty good.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean much like we talked about with Card charge-offs, right, there is some seasonality. So the first quarter revenue rate would normally be seasonally higher. Having said that, you're right, we do see some revenue outperformance in the Card space a little bit. And so a big point, if you were to ask me 11.25%, well, it's certainly a very, very solid expectation, probably higher for the year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean, I just -- first of all, I would just talk a tiny bit about the quarter because I think it's important and it's instructive. First of all, last quarter was a -- last -- this quarter last year, I'm sorry, was a record and so not that we don't always want to repeat or beat those, I still feel like we did pretty well. And it's a little bit like the Fixed Income story. Last year, equities and Equity Markets and DCM was up and M&A was less strong and this year that turned around. And I would say as we look at the results in ECM and DCM that were down, there were a few -- we were under-indexed to the larger fee events for a combination of reasons, some outside of our control and some regrettable. And also some deals that we had hoped would close moved into the second quarter, which is all to say that actually, if you look across the board, M&A still looks strong, DCM and ECM pipelines also look strong. Overall, the pipeline is well ahead of this time last year. So as long as the market remains constructive, we should continue to see reasonable momentum across products, but as you say, thematically M&A and equities, likely to benefit more strongly than DCM in a rate-rising environment. And so confidence is strong, activity levels, we saw announced volumes are up. We printed a #1 wallet M&A quarter. So as long as market volatility, regulatory-driven (inaudible) uncertainty doesn't escalate, we're feeling pretty good about the second quarter and into the year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean I'll make just some thematic comments and if you still have questions, you can maybe speak to IR because I don't have everything in front of me. But I will tell you this, we compete with everyone across the board. We compete with the large money center banks, we compete with regional banks, with local banks and so there's plenty of competition in all markets and we monitor the market dynamics, as you say, at a pretty granular level and so we will respond accordingly. And I think we do pretty well across the board and I wouldn't call anyone out as standing out or anyone out as clearly being more challenging, but that's an ongoing sort of iterative dynamic process. So we compete -- everywhere we compete, we compete with a lot of people who want these higher quality liquidity deposits or they want these relationships, and so do we.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So with deposit betas, you have to sort of dig deep because there's a sort of full spectrum. We are, as an industry, firmly on a reprice journey, no doubt. And so the sort of state of play and the maturity of that reprice journey depends upon the specifics of the business and the client. And so at the -- sort of at the Wholesale sort of top end, reprice is really reasonably high. Not to say that there's nowhere left to go, but it's reasonably high and pretty consistent. And as you go down through into the Middle Market space and small business and all the way down to the retail space, it's still relatively early days given the absolute level of rate. And so we continue to see the journey. As I said, we've seen migration in Asset & Wealth Management now for a few quarters as people are sort of reassessing deposits versus investments. We're retaining those investments, so we feel good about that. That is generally a precursor to what we will see in retail at some point in the future, not yet. But with respect to the final part of your question, which was are we still feeling like the trajectory we showed you is our central case and the answer is yes at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I can't really comment in dollars. Let me -- I'll tell -- 2 things. The first is that we've given you, so for 2018 anyway, our expectation of the revenue rate that will be now likely above the 11.25% we previously said. I will tell you we are largely -- we have lapped. We have lapped the Sapphire Reserve quarters now, right. So the big quarters, the 100,000 quite premier quarters, those were in the fourth quarter and the first quarter -- the fourth quarter of 2016, the first quarter of last year. So I would call that in the rearview mirror now. And from here, we grow with the growth in the accounts and the businesses and the spend. So we still expect to grow, but remember that also in that rebaselining, and I can't remember which period you called out, but also remember we have gone through a whole renegotiation of all our Card's co-brand relationships, too, that have an impact. So growth will be an offset. We've had some structural step-down for the reprice of the co-brand, albeit they're still great partnerships and we consider them valuable. Sapphire, we've lapped and from here, hopefully, we just continue to grow.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sure. Let me just start like at top of the house and say that we've been talking about globally investing in bankers and the salespeople and technology and building out our platforms across the cash and prime space. It is the case because we were not competitive in sort of international synthetic prime years ago and we now have among best-in-class sort of platform that, that has been part of the growth driver. So I would say EMEA international prime has been a bright spot generally. So MiFID II, so I would say that there was a concern about pullback in trading. We saw a bit of hesitation, particularly actually in Fixed Income, less so in equities, but the market was generally being quite resilient. And so we're still only relatively early days, and within the results that we have articulated to you, we've seen material increases in EMEA electronic trading, which we think will be likely somewhat permanent where people are choosing to do high-touch cash trading. We're seeing some concentration among players, which is all to say that we are seeing the industry wallet decline and margins compress, but for us, in particular, we're also benefiting from higher volumes. We think we're gaining some share and we're benefiting from some of that concentration among top players. So net-net, yes, I think there's been some pressure on the in-scope wallet, but less so than you would think for us. And it's early days, we'll just have to keep watching it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, thank you, guys. Thanks very much.",0.0900000000000003,-0.6829999999999996,0,0.09191400280328228,0.11005266601011279
4,Q4_2011,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Want to give it a shot and I will (technical difficulty).
JAMIE DIMON: We basically expect our overhead -- i.e., non-IB comp -- to be about flat next year. Remember that's after a lot of investments too, so it is not -- I think we have pretty good expense control. The other thing I want to say about IB comp -- no, I think you will see it stay around those numbers, but there is an awful lot of pressure. We are getting an awful lot of pressure for our bankers and traders to increase our payout ratio to about what newspapers and media have, which is a little bit higher.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, yes, so if you look at the overhead -- which I forgot, it was like almost $50 billion a year -and that is ex-IB comp and things, if we have a litigation or something like that, to be essentially flat. So that's -the way you should think about that is we're making huge investments. And if we have opportunities to market or grow stuff, we change it all the time.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so let me answer the first part. I think what you need to see is employment. That is what you need to see. Because employment in our opinion will drive household formation. But if you look at the other factors, okay? We are destroying more homes than we built in the last several years. We have added 10 million Americans. We're going to add 3 million Americans every year for the next 10 years; that is 30 million Americans who need 13 million dwellings or something like that. Household formation has been half what it normally is, and most economists tell us that is going to come back with job creation. And the so-called shadow inventory is coming down, not going up. So for all the chatter about it, it is very high. Rental -- in half the markets in America it is now cheaper to rent than to buy -- it is cheaper to buy than to rent. Housing is at all-time affordability. And my guess is that mortgage underwriting will loosen, not tighten. So if you put all those things together, you're going to have a turn at one point. Look, I don't know if it's three months, six months, nine months, but it's getting closer.
JAMIE DIMON: It was much more sensitive to it going down, because we have to take capital losses, than going up, where we don't get appreciation. So to me if you have housing get better, our charge-offs will just start to rapidly go down.
JAMIE DIMON: And you'll see real improvement in the mortgage portfolio, and then we won't need all the reserves. So you get both of those things.
JAMIE DIMON: We also would have hopefully active mortgage markets and a healthy economy, and that would be great.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm going to put Volcker aside, okay? Because that really hasn't been written yet. There are a lot of things coming out about it. You can come up with a scenario which is not good. I should remind everybody on the phone, but we -- the United States has the widest and deepest and most transparent capital markets in the world. You should repeat that over and over, particularly when you go to Washington. The widest, deepest, and the most liquid -- i.e., for buyers and sellers, very narrow spreads. That is a very good thing. Okay? The beneficiaries of very narrow spreads are the investors of the world. So if you create -- if you lose liquidity, you lose market makers, you are going to -- it is going to cost retirees, pensioners, firemen, retired military, more money to invest their money. So we need those things, and I think we've got to be very careful we don't destroy that as we try to limit what I -- a fair limit they want to put on proprietary trading. So at the end of the day, I think we will deal with that later. But beyond that I think it's -- secular is permanent? Which one is it -- nor not permanent. I think the trading -- think of the trading this way. Because we have 16,000 clients around the world. The amount of money they are going to need to invest in the next 10 years is going to double. So I think you have underlying growth, the same kind of underlying growth you had in the 2000s, '90s, the '80s, the '70s, the '60s. And of course spreads will change and products will change and competition will change. That's pretty good. So we are going to be in the business. We make markets actively for people. We are very good at it. And those institutions, 16,000, which include pension plans and governments and corporations, those are required services. You need to have people making markets in that so people can move securities. So you are starting to see a lot of people understand that. The volumes itself in the marketplace obviously go up or down pretty dramatically not just by quarter, but sometimes by day.
JAMIE DIMON: (multiple speakers) I don't know what liquidity metrics you are talking about, but I think what I am saying is that I think what the ECB did was a very, very powerful thing. Okay? Which is extending the collateral and three-year funding. So powerful, in fact, I think you could probably make the statement it eliminates bank liquidity or funding problems for at least next year. That is a pretty powerful statement. That was the biggest single risk of an uncontrollable surprise right there. So if that is taken off the table, that is a good thing. Now, the banks still have to increase capital; so therefore they are still reducing RWA -- i.e., by not rolling things over. You can see them signing aircraft loans, trade finance, but they're not participating much in revolvers. There are certain conduits they are not doing any more. So you see them, but that is now just to create capital, not because they have a funding crisis. So look, I think Europe is trying mightily to solve its problems. I still think like the likely outcome is they will muddle through. But the longer you wait the higher you run a risk of something disorderly that you can't really control. So I think the ECB took off the worst outcome -- i.e., a bank failure.
JAMIE DIMON: The other thing I would say, and it is quite obvious -- I just got back from Berlin yesterday. That regulatory policy is completely contradictory to government objectives. They should start talking to each other a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so this is -- first of all, most of the assets we have are just -- I'm going to call ordinary course of business, to maintain our trading books and credit for clients. So are we going to be aggressively bidding for assets from overseas? No. We have done some. You see that in the portfolio; it was up $10 billion. Some of that came out of Europe. But again, going back to contradictory policy, most of us want to get our capital up and therefore we are not going to do it.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, but they are clearer bad. I will give you a very specific example, because there was one security we looked at that if you look at we believe would have had a 10% cash return. It really required very little -- some economic capital. Basel III statutory requirement was 1,200% capital. That is an 8% pretax return, 5.5% after-tax. We are not going to do it. That's all. That's life. Not a big deal for us. It is not great for the recovery of the global market.
JAMIE DIMON: Because remember, that is not just one security. That filters through what people are doing everywhere.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, yes, well, listen. We are still -- we are doing RWA in the budgets at a very detailed level and LCR and all that. So, yes, we're going to have to manage; we're going to manage at a -- really micromanage RWA. So, yes, there are assets we're going to put on that we think will have very good RWA returns and we'll probably be much more sensitive to that for now than we would be in the past.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we are not pulling back. The overhead number I think we already mentioned, the $50 billion, is I believe going to be pretty consistent so far for next year. The headcount, let me just put in three things. We always gain efficiencies, which you don't see, in tech, ops, overhead, a whole bunch of stuff. And we have added -- and we break it out -- you've got to do it by business. But branches, so we have added 3,000 salespeople in branches in Consumer; some of that is the new branches, some of it is in existing branches. We are adding private bankers. We are adding branches overseas. We opened 20 branches overseas, mostly for TS&S. So all those things add people. But the biggest add, which we will not be adding any more, was to handle default. So there is -- I forgot the total number. We have added 15,000 people the last two years, maybe more, just to handle default.
JAMIE DIMON: In mortgage. That number has probably peaked and I think you will see it coming down over the next couple years.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no, no. Not OREO. Well, also OREO; but it's 15,000 to 20,000 just to deal with default servicing, OREO, foreclosed assets, and all that kind of stuff.
JAMIE DIMON: So those numbers will -- I think it is now running
JAMIE DIMON: Of which two-thirds is default now, and that default number is going to come down over the next couple years, and the headcount related to that too.
JAMIE DIMON: Just to keep it simple, we are still assuming another point or two percent drop across-the-board in
JAMIE DIMON: All things being equal.
JAMIE DIMON: No, my guess -- I go the other way. We have almost $9 billion of reserves for mortgages. We have got $3 billion in reserves for repurchase. Charge-offs are coming down. It is more likely than not we are going to have excess reserves, and this will be reversing at one point. To me it will be when the economy gets stronger.
JAMIE DIMON: Again, when I talk about contradictory regulatory policy, when I was in Berlin they were complaining that no banks were lending to other banks. Well, of course not. If you look at the -- the banks are being penalized for lending to banks. The G-SIFI charge specifically penalizing lending to banks. And the FDIC charge of 10 basis points is on interbank lending. There will be no interbank lending ever again. Now, maybe that is the wise policy in the future; that is perfectly reasonable. It is not reasonable now, but that is what we did.
JAMIE DIMON: But one point, we do finance banks. We do have some credit out to banks, and we do do some secured funding. So we do deal with banks. That is very different than interbank placing, where they get unsecured short-term funds.
JAMIE DIMON: I think it reduces the pressure on them. But they have this 9% capital target they have to do by June. So I think -- you've got to ask them. I think that is what is pushing them to shed risk-weighted assets, to get to that 9%. Most of them are not going to issue equity -- nor would I if I were them.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I think what I said originally -- I know we flip-flopped on this a little. But originally we said there is no reason to get there early. And then at your conference I said maybe 9% by the end of 2012. We are going to drive it up. Okay? We have just put in CCAR. The Fed is giving out more guidance that they would like to see people -- the way I am going to word it -- is like make real progress on getting to the -- well for us, getting to the 9.5%, of course by 2018. We are going to do that. So it may not be quite 9%, because we do like our stock and we don't mind buying back stock. But I just think you're going to have people getting there quicker rather than slower.
JAMIE DIMON: People want to get out of the yoke of this thing at one point. I mean, we have got to get this behind us. The good news about the CCAR in my opinion is it should, I hope, definitively get rid of this capital issue once and for all. If banks can demonstrate that at 13% unemployment, a market down 50%, home prices down 20%, a catastrophe in the US market sales and trading, a catastrophe in European credit in sales and trading, and with all that you are still way above Basel 1.5? It makes two points -- we've got plenty of capital and we don't need more. We are going to -- I think that point is going to be quite openly and blatantly when people release the results of the CCAR.
JAMIE DIMON: Commercial Bank is 100% US and has nothing to do with European banks. From what we can see, it is continuing and it is very broad-based in terms of clientele, etc. It is not utilization; it is actually just new lines of credit for the most part.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Modest uptick in utilization. But the reason we don't really know is -- remember we had a lot of bankers particularly in Florida and California, which is new to us. So we know -- and we have got I think it is $2 billion of total loans came out of those areas. So we know some of our growth is -- with new area stuff obviously you have some market share issues as opposed to --. But I think when other banks report, you're going to see good loan growth numbers in commercial banking in the US. Again, if you look at our numbers, small business up 52%. Trade finance up 73%. Investment Banking -- they are all -- we are starting to see pretty good growth.
JAMIE DIMON: The Commercial Bank it's been for six quarters now.
JAMIE DIMON: We are not macroeconomists. Okay? If you want to know about that, you should figure that out yourself.
JAMIE DIMON: That bounces all over the place. That includes bridge loans and it does include like $5 billion or $6 billion of conduits we put in there. We don't expect to see that kind of loan growth every quarter in that portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: No, they are not.
JAMIE DIMON: The wholesale line you're looking at is the consolidated wholesale, right?
JAMIE DIMON: Which I don't -- and does that include (multiple speakers)?
JAMIE DIMON: Right. The wholesale loans, no. Other then we have mentioned $5 billion -- maybe it was a little bit more -- relating to European loans that we bought, or conduits. I don't expect that to continue. It might. So that is not a flight to quality. That is just other people who are trying to get rid of their assets. There is no
JAMIE DIMON: More than $100 billion year-over-year. My guess is a lot of that was flight to quality. It is very hard for us to distinguish because some of this is big money sitting there. Companies are flush with cash and their cash balances are growing. Some are new accounts. So we estimate that a chunk of that might be that, but we don't make a lot of money on that. So, the part -whatever you would call the flight to quality or something like that, we are making very little on it. We almost do that more to accommodate the client.
JAMIE DIMON: You have three completely different things. So, obviously, our operating leverage has gotten worse because of regulations, Durbin, etc. That is a fact. That is number one. Number two, we open branches. And I said we are modifying that, because a lot of these changes do affect branch profitability. But to the extent that we can open a branch and get a very good return, we're going to continue to do it. Remember, a lot of this is in California, Florida where there is a huge benefit to clustering -- i.e., increasing your market share inside local markets. So we're going to modify it, the size of the branch, location, type of product services. But we're going to continue to open branches as long as we think every time you open a branch you are getting a very good return. And the third one was --?
JAMIE DIMON: This is a very important thing. We have decided -- and you may decide differently and think we're wrong. But we have decided that the value of the deposits is more and we are not going to treat it like they are very low for the sake of our business. The value of the deposit will come back and we will regret having not continued growing our business as normal. And the profits will go up, because eventually margins will go back to more normal type of things over time. That is a decision we made -- open to comment or criticism. But as of now, unless someone can prove otherwise, that is what we are going to do.
JAMIE DIMON: You're welcome.
JAMIE DIMON: You know, honestly, your guess is as good as ours. Look, we have had a pretty good start so far, but it's only so many trading days. Look, we could be surprised on the upside, the downside; who knows?
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it was 11% return on tangible common equity, and we would like to be closer to 15%. So that is all we meant. A big part of the difference is there is still a huge drag for mortgage. I mean you're talking about several billion dollars a year, just from mortgage alone. That drag is going down, but it is still a negative. Eventually, that will disappear.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. Dividends, first of all, dividend is a small decision from a capital standpoint. So whether we raise it a little bit here or there is not going to be material. We still -- we started the dividend again. We would like to increase it a little bit every year. That is a Board decision. When the stock is very cheap and particularly below tangible book value, I like to buy a lot back. Which, of course, we can't do by the time we are allowed to buy a lot of stock back, I'm sure it is going to be a much higher price. And then we may change our decision about that. So you can get a little frustration in my -- about how we have had to do our capital buyback. But we are getting more clarity from the Fed. The Fed has asked for these stress tests. The stress tests -- all the banks have put in their CCAR, and we are going to tell you what that is when we get it back. But I am not going to change the statement I made at the Goldman conference, which was we hope to be able to do a little more than we did in 2011.
JAMIE DIMON: You're welcome.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no, no. Unrelated. It just says that deposit-related fees were up a little bit. Don't look at it as an offset to Durbin.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a factual statement.
JAMIE DIMON: So, the LCR -- and you guys have all seen this -- has huge amount of detail behind it. We are in favor of good detail. And they got a lot of comments. Why are Ginnie Maes at a 15% discount? How come equities aren't in there? How come Goldman isn't in there? How come the liquid assets? And they got a lot of comments that the drawdown on deposits is too high. Millions of comments. They have acknowledged some of those comments. Let them come back, and when we get the final stuff we will tell you.
JAMIE DIMON: Some of the stuff in the LCR was absurd. Okay? So hopefully they will be responsive at least to the absurd parts.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no, no. That's normal balance sheet management.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know yet. But, Guy, I don't think it is going to be material to us any which way. There's really -- if we have to make some adjustments, we will make some adjustments.
JAMIE DIMON: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: It's very simple, okay? You see the numbers. They moderated. And maybe there will be a little improvement going forward. What made us change our mind is the accountant said we had to. I would have left the reserves up if it was solely up to me.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, that's another question. I like having a strong -- look, eventually we have $9 billion reserves we don't need, okay? So just until we get through all this uncertainty, I would rather just have them up. But basically the numbers have gotten too good over time to leave up that amount of reserves.
JAMIE DIMON: But one of the things in the stress test, not just for us but for a lot of banks, is the portfolios are smaller. They've got a lot more reserves up, and a lot of the bad stuff has run through. So loss rates won't go up as much. I am talking about in a real stress test -- and you won't need to add as much to reserves, from where we were a couple years ago.
JAMIE DIMON: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: By the way, I just got a note that one of the newspapers out there thinks that we haven't done a full disclosure on Europe. The reason we didn't add a European theme is pretty much like it was last quarter. Not much has changed, so -- if anyone is interested.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you are confusing two things. The GSE putback number, that is the $350 million that we had, those numbers are basically timing difference. Just, there was like $3 billion of reserves; we don't expect a real change in that. Some of that, there were pieces of that that were settled relating to WaMu. I forgot which one, it was Fannie or Freddie.
JAMIE DIMON: Litigation. We put up a lot of those reserves for litigation.
JAMIE DIMON: We have no comment on that.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm sorry. What's the question?
JAMIE DIMON: You know, look, I don't want to give you quite a number yet. But it may not be 9%, but it will be 8.5% or something like that. We are going to make a lot of progress towards getting to the 9.5%.
JAMIE DIMON: And my guess is we will be at the 9%. And maybe get to 9.5% right away, because it wouldn't be that hard to do if we wanted to do it. I don't think it would be good policy, but it's helping an economic recovery. And my guess is we will be at 9.5% by the end of 2013.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think you -- I think we already disclosed a lot of what they -- what the SEC said people were going to disclose. Right? There is very little to add. So for us it is not a lot different than what we showed. I think other people didn't show that kind of detail. You're going to get more detail.
JAMIE DIMON: With a little more detail.
JAMIE DIMON: Overall.
JAMIE DIMON: But we are not building Asia for next quarter. We are covering a lot of clients and the volumes will go up or down, and we are going to build there, we have opened branches there. We are building a Global Corporate Bank there. We are covering more clients there. That is going to continue. The volumes themselves will be volatile.
JAMIE DIMON: It's exactly what I said in the third quarter. There is a page that you can go get from that presentation I made at Goldman. It is about 175 branches, and we are looking at things like size and technology and locations. But we're still going to be opening branches particularly in California and Florida, where we need more share. There is nothing mystical about it. We have to adjust it. Some of the regulatory changes made certain branches less profitable, etc. That's all.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, we had to get rid of the too-big-to-fail thing, because I think companies had to be allowed to fail. And therefore I think we need to help show people that resolution is real. So you're going to see us be making a little bit of effort on that. How can you dismantle a big bank in a way that doesn't damage the taxpayer or the economy in any material way? We are still under the 10% cap. Look, I think it would probably be a political firestorm if we tried to buy someone in the United States. If we thought it was really, really good for shareholders, we would want to do it; and we would be willing to have a little mud on our face. But, we need regulatory approval. So if we can't get regulatory approval, then we are not going to try. The United States is still -- counter to all this chatter about too-big-to-fail, the United States is the least consolidated banking market in the world and there are still too many banks. And unfortunately, some of the -- all of these regulatory things are tougher on smaller banks than bigger banks. So you are going to see a lot of them wanting to sell or merge.
JAMIE DIMON: It is reflected in the run rate in the fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I think in Credit Card we are near the end of reserve release if that is what you are referring to. (multiple speakers) Credit is very good and hopefully it will stay good. It may get a little better, but I think we are near the end. In terms of mortgage, I think we already mentioned of the $9 billion, one day you won't need all that. But we need far more improvement in charge-offs, delinquencies, all that before that reserve will come down.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but just call it steady-state now in most of the wholesale areas. Strong reserves, but steady-state. If we grow, you're going to have a little build, yes -- all things being equal, which they are not. But yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Net CVA was very small. So at a steady-state that line called Credit Portfolio would be a couple hundred million dollar positive. But of course if you look at it, it bounces all over the place because of CVA and DVA effects.
JAMIE DIMON: Not much. It was a little bit. There were a lot of things in there, okay? Home prices, paydown rates, how we look at -- what kind of required returns we need on the MSR itself. The option-adjusted return. So there were large model updates with a lot of pluses and minuses.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, what I have seen -- not really, okay? There have been more announcements than actions.
JAMIE DIMON: Today I guess it was RBS who said M&A and equity is going to stay in Fixed Income, so we haven't really seen it. Maybe if I went and walked -- ask the traders; they may have seen a little bit. But eventually you are going to -- there will be some people exiting some of the things and those who remain will probably pick up a little share because of it.
JAMIE DIMON: No, it is just a function of our own funding needs.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you should not really expect it to go down.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I guess my point is I think a lot of people want to get past all this, and go back to --. Look, we should always have stress tests and liquidity and stuff like that. But when the rules are known, you should -- we shouldn't be guessing about what we want to retain in capital and how fast you want to get there and what the requirements are and what the phase-in is. So all that uncertainty should be eliminated. Here are the rules that banks have lived by. That's all.
JAMIE DIMON: Unrelated, okay? So it is still imminent. It would be nice to get it done, but there are still open issues and we have been working mightily to try to get it done, because I think it would be better. I think it would be good for the mortgage markets to move on. I think that anything that can get resolved is better for the mortgage markets. But it has nothing to do with the reserves, though it will affect numbers. We will have to account for whatever the agreement is, and we have already done some of that. So there will be some adjustment because of it. But it won't really affect reserves that much.
JAMIE DIMON: I should mention, it is embedded in the reserves.
JAMIE DIMON: But it probably will have no major net effect.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't -- look, if it were up to me, I think that someone in authority should convene all the people involved in mortgage businesses and -- because this could be fixed. It's three years after the crisis. There are virtually no RMBS. We don't know the skin in the game rules. Foreclosure is being up held up everywhere, which is damaging the economy. I mean, you can blame the banks; most of that is the economy. These things could be fixed. You could have much more mortgage markets. Underwriting is still tight. I think underwriting will probably loosen over time. It is tight for a whole bunch of different reasons. And obviously GSE policy is critical, as is HARP 2 and all these things. But there is no one really in charge of all this. It is just kind of sitting there.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. If someone (multiple speakers) together and made some good decisions, I think you would have a much more rapid recovery in housing.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me add to your confusion here a second. Okay? We are running Basel I, Basel II, Basel 2.5, and Basel III. Remember, the European Banks are already on, in effect, Basel 2.5. So they just have to go from 2.5 to III, where the American banks had to go from I to III. So when they say they've got to get 9%, it is not Tier 1 Common -- it is Tier 1 Core, which is slightly different -- by June of 2012, that is an accelerated getting there ready. They have already got I would say most of Basel III in that. Maybe I am a little wrong on that, but I think most of Basel III is already incorporated in Basel 2.5. But it has put a lot of pressure on these banks in Europe, who -- look they in the past have overleveraged, there is too much unsecured funding. But they operated under that scheme for a long time, sanctioned by the states. This is why I say it is completely pro-cyclical what is being caused in Europe right now. So, will it change? I don't know. Will that change what American regulators want to do? I don't think so.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but I've got to leave that to them. We have got to run our business here, and I do think it causes a lot of confusion. If you speak to banks in Europe, they are -- they think a lot will get done now. And they know it is pro-cyclical, and they think some of this stuff is silly. But let them tell you what they need to do about it.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, it was true-ups.
JAMIE DIMON: I just mentioned about Europe, by the way, because like I said I was in Berlin yesterday, and that -- it is quite clear when you speak to like the ECB, and they did the three-year funding, there why aren't banks making loans and buying sovereign debt? So it's got this huge arbitrage. You can earn 4%, 5%, 6%, and finance it at 1%. But if you ask the banks, they are saying -- I can't buy sovereign debt because I am already being criticized heavily by other regulators about my sovereign debt, my quota. I've got to get all those numbers down. So over there it is quite clear that regulatory policy, government policy, Central Bank policy, it is not coordinated. And it's making the situation worse, not better.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, look, I think the ECB did the right thing. Because when the banks are -- when everybody is questioning the sovereign debt and everybody is questioning unsecured debt and everybody is questioning wholesale debt, and everybody is questioning -- the banks had to get funding. What is the ECB supposed to do? Let them not get funding?
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I have been very consistent. I think we are shooting ourselves in the foot everywhere around the world. I don't know how to say it. I have said it 100 times. I am not complaining. JPMorgan will be fine, but that is what we are doing. No one is really in charge in putting these things together and realizing the negative effect it is causing. We can get through it all; it is just going to take it -- it's going to make it more painful and slower. We all want jobs. This is not job creating.
JAMIE DIMON: The default fees will be close to zero.
JAMIE DIMON: That will stay.
JAMIE DIMON: I think someone put a slide out somewhere else that actually showed what it will remain. So it will come down quite a bit, but not all the way.
JAMIE DIMON: No, the CCAR will allow us to -- we're going to be told what we can buy back in terms of stock or not. We have applied, so we will get a response on March 15th. So you will know on March 15th what we know. Forget what is open.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, please, don't take words -- I'm not talking about the regulators. I'm talking about the inconsistent policy between certain regulatory policies, certain government policy, and the so-called objective to get the economies of the world going again. They are inconsistent.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I don't know. Look, everyone wants to get the mortgage market healthier. I think the Fed in that White Paper also showed that costs are higher than they should be. The mortgage costs. If you reduced the mortgage costs, the spreads over 10 years and stuff like that could be -- I forgot the number -- 30 or 40 basis points cheaper. And I agree with them. That is not going to happen where -- you can't foreclose on homes. It is not going to happen if you don't have RMBS. So it is more of a -- you need a holistic approach to get it all done. So I am not -- I think the Fed is right that there should be a holistic approach. We put in the press release that we have offered 1.2 million mortgage modifications. Okay? And that we have actually completed 400,000, and that we are making 765,000 mortgages a year. So with all due respect, we are making mortgages all day long. We are signing to the GSEs we want to be in the business. On the servicing side mistakes were made. They are being fixed. We are paying for them, and we should. We should pay for the mistakes we made. But let's keep the mortgage market active. You did see Ally say they are not going to do mortgages in Massachusetts anymore because of certain litigation there and stuff like that. That is not a good thing.
JAMIE DIMON: I also don't agree that somehow principal forgiveness would be the end-all, the be-all. Okay? There are 75 million homes. 25 million don't have mortgages. Of the 45 million or so with mortgages, 4 million of those mortgages are having problems, and we are working through those. Those who can't afford to stay in their home, the loans in effect are being written off and forgiven. Okay? Millions of mods are being offered; all of the banks are doing it as aggressively as they can. And all the banks have geared up to try to handle just the raw amount of defaults and stuff like that. We support HARP 1, we support HARP 2, we supported HAMP, and we're doing our own mortgage modifications on top of that.
JAMIE DIMON: I think -- and we want to see a recovery in the housing markets. We would do anything we can to get a recovery in the housing markets.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I don't remember the commentary that came after it. I think some of the things in the White Paper were interesting. If I was the powers that be -- I have already said this -- I would convene all the people involved in the business. I would close the door. I would stay there until we resolved a bunch of these issues so we could have a more healthy mortgage market. I think if you had RMBS, if you finished skin in the game, if you change reps and warranties, if we made -- if we figured out how you can deal with seconds and firsts, you could fix all this -- if someone was in charge. No one is in charge.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I don't know. The Board -- when we started them -- I am very consistent -- said we hoped to do a little bit of increase every year. That is what we hope to do. When the Board talks about it, they are going to decide what that number is.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think it is that critical to our Company. You are talking about small numbers relative to all these other things.
JAMIE DIMON: And it's normal modeling. It is nothing special. It is normal modeling that was expected at Basel III that we just hadn't built yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, and part of this model was run off.
JAMIE DIMON: Then we will actively do stuff, too. Believe me, we will very actively do stuff. It's just not (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: Go on.
JAMIE DIMON: Behind which one?
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, let's do this again. We're going to do it the last time. There are -- we are running off -- is it $100 billion of RWA? Where there's loans or high RWA assets that we are not going to regenerate again, that are going to run off the books, there is nothing we need to do. That includes high RWA loans. It includes all these mortgages loans that's running off. Then there are models which we are just building which are normal modeling and stuff like that that we're allowed to put into Basel III, which will do another whole chunk of reduction in RWA. Do you have the chart right there?
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. $100 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay.
JAMIE DIMON: Folks, thank you for spending some time with us, and we will talk to you soon.",-0.020000000000000014,0.055999999999999495,1,0.07884797709162944,0.12122447983228282
5,Q1_2019,"
MARIANNE LAKE, EXECUTIVE VP & CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported record net income of $9.2 billion and EPS of $2.65 on record revenue of nearly $30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. The results this quarter were strong and broad-based. Highlights include core loan growth ex CIB of 5% with loan trends continuing to progress as expected. Credit performance remained strong across businesses. We saw record client investment assets in Consumer of over $300 billion and record new money flows this quarter. And double-digit growth in both Card sales and merchant processing volume, up 10% and 13%, respectively. We ranked #1 in Global IB fees and gained meaningful share with share well above 9% this quarter. In the Commercial Bank, we had record growth IB revenue. In Asset & Wealth Management, record AUM and client assets. And the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage. Turning to Page 2, and talking into more detail about the first quarter. Revenue of $29.9 billion was up $1.3 billion or 5% year-on-year driven by net interest income which was up $1.1 billion or 8% on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix. Noninterest revenue was up slightly as reported. But excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year, NIR would have been up 5%, reflecting Auto lease growth and strong Investment Banking fees, and while Markets revenue was lower, there were other items more than offsetting. Expense of $16.4 billion was up 2% relating to continued investments we're making in technology, real estate, marketing and front office, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of a little over $200 million. Credit remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $330 million year-on-year driven by changes in Wholesale reserves. In Consumer, charge-offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserve this quarter. In Wholesale, we had about $180 million of credit costs driven by reserve build on select C&I client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy. Once again, these downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names and across sectors. Net reserve builds of this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolios, and we are not seeing signs of deterioration. Moving on to Page 3 and balance sheet and capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.1%, up modestly from last quarter with the benefit of strong earnings and AOCI gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk-weighted assets. RWA is up primarily due to higher counterparty credit on trading activity, but notably this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis. Quarter-on-quarter, loans were down in Home Lending as a result of a loan sale transaction in the CIB and the result of a large syndication and in Card and Asset & Wealth Management seasoning. Also in the page, total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, principally driven by higher CIB trading assets, in part, a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions. Lower end-of-period loans are partially offset by Treasury balances, including higher securities. In the quarter, the firm distributed $7.4 billion of capital to shareholders including $4.7 billion of share repurchases, as our -- pre-submitted our 2019 CCAR capital plan to the Federal Reserve. Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30% with consumers remaining strong and confident. Core loans were up 4% here year-on-year driven by Home Lending and Cards both up 6% and Business Banking up 3%. Deposits grew 3%, in line with our expectations, and we believe we continue to outperform. Client investment assets were up 13% driven by record new money flows reflecting growth across physical and digital channels including You Invest. We also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets. Revenue of $13.8 billion was up 9%. Consumer & Business Banking revenue up 15% on higher deposit NII driven by continued margin expansion. Home Lending revenue was down 11% driven by net servicing revenue on both lower operating revenue and MSR. But notably, while volumes are down, production revenue is up nicely year-on-year on disciplined pricing. And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 9% driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher Auto lease volumes. Expense of $7.2 billion was up 4% driven by investments in the business and Auto lease depreciation partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On credit, net charge-offs were flat as lower charge-offs in Home Lending and Auto were offset by higher charge-offs in Card on loan growth. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across lending portfolios. Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion and an ROE of 16% on strong revenue performance of nearly $10 billion. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 10% year-on-year. And outside of an accounting nuance, all of advisory, DCM and total IB fees would have been records for a first quarter. Advisory fees were up 12% in a market that was down benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter. We ranked #1 in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share. Debt underwriting fees were up 21%, also outperforming a market that was down driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead-left positions in leveraged finance. We maintained our #1 rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share. And equity underwriting fees were down 23% but in the market down more as the combination of the government shutdown, uncertainty around Brexit and residual impacts from December volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter. But already in the second quarter, we've seen a major recovery in U.S. IPO volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and health care sectors which again dominate the calendar. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $5.5 billion, down 17% reported or down 10% adjusted for the impact of the accounting standard last year that I referred to. Big picture, on a year-on-year basis, we are challenged by a tough comparison. The backdrop in the first quarter of '18 was supportive, clients were active and we saw broad-based strength in performance with a clear record in Equities last year. In contrast, this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept clients on the sidelines despite a recovered and more favorable environment. So with that in mind, I would categorize the results as solid and a little better than we thought at Investor Day just a few weeks ago largely due to a better second half of March. And for what it's worth so far, the environment in April feels generally constructive, but it's too early to draw any conclusions in terms of P&L. Fixed Income Markets revenue was down 8% adjusted driven by lower activity, particularly in rates and in Currencies & Emerging Markets which normalized following a strong prior year. However, we did see relative strength in Credit Trading on strong flow as well as in commodities. Equities revenue was down 13% adjusted, speaking more to the record prior year quarter than this quarter's performance which was still generally strong across products. Although derivatives got off to a somewhat slower start, cash in particular nearly matched last year's exceptional result. Treasury Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, benefiting from higher balances and payments volume, being partially offset by deposit margin compression. Securities Services revenue was $1 billion, down 4% as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression, lower market levels and the impact of a business exit. Of note, deposit margin in both Treasury Services and Securities Services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis, and at the firm-wide level, was an offset. Finally, expense of $5.5 billion was down 4% driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower FDIC charges, partially offset by continued investments in the business. The cost of revenue ratio for the quarter was 30%. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. A strong quarter for the Commercial Bank with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year on strong Investment Banking performance and higher deposit NII. Record gross IB revenue of over $800 million was up more than 40% year-on-year due to several large transactions and the pipeline continues to feel robust and active. Deposit balances were down 5% year-on-year and 1% sequentially as migration of nonoperating deposits to higher-yielding alternatives have decelerated and we believe is largely behind us. From here, we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook. Expense of $873 million was up 3% year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business, in banker coverage and in technology. Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 2% or up 5% adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio. We continue to see solid growth across expansion market and specialized industries. CRE loans were up 1% as competition remains elevated and we continue to maintain discipline given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs of $90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades, and net charge-offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance. Before we move on, I want to address the perceived gap between our reported C&I growth statistics and those that we all see in the Fed's weekly data. If we look across all of our Wholesale businesses, we also show strong
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Hey, John. So I would say, just big picture, it's a combination of both, obviously. We talked at Investor Day about the fact that we're always going to make the net investment -- the net incremental investment decision based on its own merits, but in total, with the amount we're spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investment, we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years. And so that is part of it. Obviously, a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but they're also to do with operating efficiency, so we would also expect to start to see some of that drive operating leverage. But it's also the case that we're looking for revenue growth, too. So it's a combination of both.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, the first thing I would say is that we talked -- we've said this before, when we've seen these periods where you get kind of short-term fluctuations in the curve, is that it's a bit dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so. And so in the big picture, we said $58-plus billion. Yes, it's true that a persistent flatter curve would have a small net drag on carry, and we're not immune to that. So there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that if it is persistent at this level throughout the year. But we continue to grow our loans and our deposits. And against that, there's a mixed bag of lower for longer. So while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates, we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on faces necessarily. And while lower long-end rates may be a net small drag in the short term on earnings, they're good for credit on the balance sheet. And you could argue a patient Fed and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle. So net-net, there are pluses and minuses. I would say there may be some pressure as a result of that if it's persistent, but it's modest.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, I would say there's lots of different opportunities for people to get insured deposit, so we'll come back to the third point. But all of that plays a piece. So you'll recall that we built a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets, being California and Florida and Nevada and the like. And so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we're definitely seeing some growth in deposits there. I also firmly believe, and we talked about it many, many times, that we've been investing consistently over the last decade in customer experience. Customer satisfaction in our Consumer bank is at an all-time high and continues to increase consecutively. Digital products, new products and services, value propositions to our customers, convenience, new markets, all of which I think are increasingly important to our customers as well as obviously a number of other factors. So to me, it's the combination of all of the above and less so at this point a perception of a flight to quality. The people have a lot of choices. Year-over-year, I would say we're seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations. But this year, the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives. So customers are voting with their business, they're bringing deposits to us, and I think it speaks to a combination of the investments we're making and also including branches.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, I can tell you that -- and so it's not just about deposit growth as well. Remember, it's also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwind there. So I don't have a breakout for you. We can follow up. It deepens -- on our branch growth, the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence, both are important. But we can get back to you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So on the business exit, this is -- it's the sort of feature we're always talking about year-over-year that, to me, this feels like really old news. It was a U.S. broker-dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago. But obviously we're still on a year-over-year basis, for another couple of quarters, going to see the impact of that on our revenues. It's about 20 -- just over a $20 million year-on-year revenue negative impact, but it's relatively speaking, old news in terms of the exit took place last year. Lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on revenues. And then we are seeing solid underlying growth, but this is a very competitive environment. And as we are growing our assets on -- our custody assets and as we're growing and winning new mandates, these are under competitive pressures, and it also depends on mix. So there's a bunch of factors going on. What we're focused on is, for both of these businesses, that the long-term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth in the underlying businesses are performing well. And even with these revenue pressures, we're focused on continuing to drive efficiencies, and these are good ROE businesses above mid-teens. Can I -- I'm sorry, can I just make one more comment? I didn't say this on the digital space, but I think it's important as we think going forward, that as we think not just about our digital assets, but digital account opening, and that as being a feature of how we're attracting new accounts, 25% of checking production, 40% of savings production, now able to be opened digitally. So increasingly, digital will be a driver but we will get back to you with the mixes. Sorry.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So for sure, the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So mortgages in 2018, '19 are the epicenter of it for mortgage. So the market itself is smaller year-on-year, it's about 15% smaller because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates, they're still higher year-on-year than they were this time last year. So that obviously is having an impact. And as we've been -- and we're down similarly. So we've added about $6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolio, but against that, as you saw last year, we did a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter, and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet. We're trying to take loans off of our balance sheet, core loans off our balance sheet and sell them if we can reinvest in agency MBS and [nonresi] assets that have better capital liquidity characteristics. So there's going to be -- it's going to a little bit harder to look at a trend. You're going to need to look at things gross. So we are originating high-quality loans. We are adding a number of loans to our portfolio. We're distributing based on better execution as that would go. But we will continue to optimize our balance sheet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I didn't hear the second part of the question on losses, which losses were up this year that you were mentioning, but here's what I would say -- go.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would -- I applaud transparency for sure. And we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the Fed models losses for our portfolios. And we've been observing that over time. Necessarily, it's the case that the Federal Reserve model is typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily because they're industry-wide. Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now. So arguably, a little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings, that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings. But we always invest in our businesses first. So we are growing our businesses as responsibly as we can. We're adding branches, we're adding customers, we're adding advisers across our businesses. But to the degree that we have excess earnings, we'll continue to distribute them. And the ranges that we gave you at the end of February, nothing's changed.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So the color is there is really no color, which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last 8 quarters and take oil, gas, energy releases out, you would've seen quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where they're $100 million and $50 million. So there's always been the propensity for there to be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 downgrades. The thing we look for is whether or not, as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have, whether we're seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow and whether we're seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we're banking. And we're just not. So it's not to say that we aren't paying close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle, it's not to say we aren't paying close attention to retail, but the color is there is no real color. That these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter. And even if you look quarter over quarter over quarter, there's no trends to call out. And it -- we have a large Wholesale lending portfolio. These are extremely modest in the context of that. And remember, every quarter, like we talk about a few because it's non-zero. But we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter. And it's not just downgrades, it's upgrades, and they're approximately of equal measure. So we're looking very carefully at it. We understand why people are questioning and concerned. And these are cyclical businesses and the cycle will turn, but we're not seeing it yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized -- and there's geography. In the Home Lending business, when we do these mortgage loan sales, because we're match-funded, net-net, there's very little P&L. There's -- last quarter, there was a loss in NIR and an offset in rate funding in NIR. This quarter, there's a gain. So you've got a loss last quarter, a gain this quarter, both small, but nevertheless, that's driving the majority of the production margin going up. But in addition, if you just strip all that noise out, which is not material, but nevertheless significant quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So we're really, really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the United States. But when you talk about branches, you are talking about investment for the long term. And when I say long term, multiple years, decades. So with respect to the new markets that we're entering, these are extremely nascent investments. The branches, in many cases, we haven't even broken ground on. However, that said, early indications, it's very, very early indications are strongly positive. We're seeing a lot of excitement in the market. We're seeing new accounts in production a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage. On the whole, you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposits and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I just want to reiterate something that I want to make sure you guys completely internalize, which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we're getting out of each dollar of spend, that overall, our net investment should be more flat going forward than they had in the past. But we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit. That said, we've been growing our technology spend. And in particular, we've been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank. And that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital, R&D, the whole lot. It's a large number, and each year, a lot of that -- a lot of those dollars that we've been investing roll off and we get the ability to re-decision and reinvest them. So this is not that we're going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very, very heavily in the agenda, and in particular, in the technology agenda. It's just that each year, the (technical difficulty) decisions. And we'll continue to make the right decisions. And we see that being flatter going forward than it has been. And we're getting -- and we're getting more efficient. So in the past, the way that technology was delivered was very different. And the more that we're in our modern, virtualized, cloud-ready way with new technologies, each dollar of technology is more productive.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Okay. So first point on Treasury Services. Last year, our revenue growth was in double digits, you're right this quarter 3% year-on-year. I mentioned earlier that for both of our Wholesale businesses, we happened to have basis compression between the funding spread that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines. And so that, sort of just given where rates have moved, may be a headwind this year as the segment results are reported. But for the company, it's obviously net 0. The more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that, balances and payments, is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue. So you will see margins mainly compress on that. It's not speaking to deposit flows. It's not speaking to volumes and it's not speaking to escalating payouts at this point. It's only talking about the underlying organic growth of the business. With respect to technology spend, you'll recall last year, we were kind of 60-40 run the bank, change the bank. And it's more 50-50 this year. So $11.5 billion of spend, about half and half. But remember, in the change the bank, it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience, digital, data, R&D. So it's the whole spectrum.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So we did slightly better in the first quarter, 2 things driving in. One is small, but nevertheless, is arguably nonrecurring, which is we talked about the fact that, overall in the company, when we do these loan sales that net-net, there may be a small residual gain or loss, that resides in Treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in NII, call it, $50 million approximately. And then in addition, we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short-duration liquid investments that were higher-yielding than IOER. That continued into the first quarter, so we did benefit from that. And it may or may not continue but we're not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through. So I would say that day count was a drag. As you look forward with some opportunities, obviously, there's a risk associated with the flat yield curve, not big, but nevertheless, net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure if long-end rates stay lower for longer. As we don't have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the December rate hike, you could see more rates paid due a little bit more into second quarter. So there are risks and opportunities. We still think it's a decent outlook, but I don't think it's conservative. I think it's -- $58 billion is straight down the middle at this point. The trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short term, and we shouldn't over-interpret or over-chase it. At this point, I think it's a decent estimate and we'll continue to update you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well -- so I mean, we only spoke to it most recently about 6 weeks ago. So the sort of overall answer is, no, not really. We expected at that point that we would have a patient Fed. It turns out that the -- all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish, which could generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk on the balance sheet. Obviously, the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration. But there's natural risk in our balance sheet. So overall, very little. We feel good about credit. The curve's flat and we'll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I'll just -- look, the big contextual answer will always be the same, which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing, it is 100% driven by what we're observing in our consumer behaviors and what we're seeing in deposit flows. And so that's the environment that we look at to determine what's happening. And you've seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we've seen flows of deposits to higher-yielding alternatives whether it's investments or whether it's more recently in CDs, and that may continue. We'll continue to watch that. It is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end, and it's the short end that predominantly drives the deposit pricing agenda. So even if the curve is flatter, as long as it's -- because the front end is stable, I don't necessarily see deposit costs going down. But we're going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly.
MARIANNE LAKE: There are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter, but I would say it's a feature more of the extremely low base. And so from that, any movements whether they are up or down are somewhat exaggerated. But we would continue to call the credit environment benign.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, I think that as it relates to the U.S. and in particular looking at the U.S. consumer, you've got all up, jobs, more recently auto, housing spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust. And whether it's double digits or whether it's not, we're continuing to see the -- and consumer confidence, by the way, which is still very high, and has recovered from any sort of hangover from the equity market actions over the fourth quarter. So for us, U.S. Consumer has always been strong and confident. And even if we're not at an all-time high in confidence, it's still very high. And generally, the data is -- and even some like housing and auto that hasn't necessarily been super-strong, is looking encouraging. And then on the global front, it is a little harder but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit, and Europe would be a good example, we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics and Brexit, and they seem to be fading a little, business confidence has recovered a little. Businesses are still spending on labor, which is generally a good sign of underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers. And even there, there's job growth, there's wage growth that's helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having improved the least. So I mean, I think generally, we feel optimistic across the Consumer and the rest of the sector, albeit it sort of green shoots on the Wholesale side. So it's early, but it's what we were expecting to see. And so long may it continue.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say that -- a couple of things. Obviously, there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018, and so we did benefit from that. But just as a general market matter, M&A is still attractive in a low-growth environment. Albeit a growth environment, in fact, it is still constructive. North America, which is by far the biggest market for M&A is still healthy. And so Europe was a big driver last year, and Europe has seen a sharp drop-off in volumes and wallet. And so that may continue, although we have a pretty good position there. So I would say that the pipeline is down, but still M&A is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. So the market, which is usually more -- I wouldn't say pessimistic, but more in that camp, they are still only expecting an ease at the end of the year. So we are not, by the way, as you point out. So I think for 2019's NII outlook, it's not a clear and present danger that there will be a need. Obviously, we have, on the way up on rates, been overindexed to total end rates. And so clearly, if we were to have an ease, it would have an impact on our NII. If we felt generally that, that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in, then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet. But right now, the Fed is on pause. Right now, that's constructive to corporate deposit margins, constructive for credit and generally constructive for how we're positioned on the balance sheet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Yes, we do.
MARIANNE LAKE: So first of all, just sort of big picture, really high, I think is a bit of an overstatement. Higher, I think is fair. No, not really. If there were, we would have called them out. There are a few little things, so I'm just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned. We contributed $100 million to a foundation this quarter. Net-net, legal was a very, very small, but nevertheless, positive this quarter. So there were a few little bits and pieces like that. But if you look at revenue performance, we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting. We did better in IBCs and we've gained a lot of share. We did a little better in Markets. We did a little better in NII. So just a little bit of a wind at our backs sort of phenomenon. My -- probably my best answer to you is as happy as we are with the performance, and we are, gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we've got in our businesses, we are not making material changes to our full year outlook. So we'll still see how market performs for the year. We do still expect, as Daniel mentioned at Investor Day, that while we feel great about our positioning in Investment Banking in the first quarter, Coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5% and 10% year-on-year. So we do expect to gain share to help offset that, but last year was a record. So we haven't changed our full year guidance at all yet. We'll take this as a very good down payment for that. And if markets are constructive and wallet expands, we'll benefit from that. But we're not leading it across and changing everything.
MARIANNE LAKE: So as best I know, there is a chance but not necessarily a probability that there could be an SCB proposal for 2020 CCAR. So there's a meet -- a set of meetings or a meeting that's coming up some time in the summer that I think might be an important moment. But we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand in a better way to bring growth capital together with point-in-time capital, but it's complicated. So as we said, the most important thing is not to issue an SCB proposal that doesn't deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively. So we're talking about GSIB. We're talking about minimums. We're talking about Basel. We're talking about SCB. It's complicated. I'd say there's a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 CCAR.
MARIANNE LAKE: I mean, yes. If you look at payout ratios obviously sort of described as a percentage, then we said over the longer term, we'd expect to pay out, in a benign environment, between 75% and 100%. And analysts have estimates of 90%-plus. And obviously, as earnings grow, that would be a bigger dollar number. But again, we'll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise. So we'll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds. But you're right. As earnings continue to grow, a strong payout ratio, we're above our -- the top end of our capital range, so we are starting at a robust level, would be a higher dollar number, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I do quite -- sorry, go, Jamie.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So quarter-on-quarter, and I think I mentioned a couple of these things. But we, across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end-of-period basis, loans are down. So like stepping through them, the first one that I would point out is mortgage, and we just talked about that, I think, earlier in the call, which is we continue to originate mortgage loans. We continue to distribute demand portfolio. But we did do a loan sale which is part of the discussion that we've been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet. We did a sale at the end of the quarter. So that's impacting our mortgage loans. And the CIB -- and one of the reasons why we called out core loan growth ex the CIB is that because we don't consider CIB loans as core because they are, just by their nature, oftentimes more episodic and lumpy. And so we did see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter. And then in our other businesses, in Asset Wealth Management, a bit of seasonality, a few pay-downs. In Card, seasonality. So it's a combination of factors, but obviously, 2 drivers, CIB and Home Lending, CIB on sort of that large syndication, Home Lending on the loan sale. Going forward, we'll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes. But just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending, I look at the middle-market space and say we're still seeing solid demand. It is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries, but we're still growing that portion of our loans in the mid-single digits year-on-year. I'm sorry Andrew. There are going to be other areas where we just won't roll up. I mean in Commercial Real Estate, you see loan growth is much lower. It's very competitive. Spreads have come down. We continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans, but we're not going to chase it down, and similarly Auto.
MARIANNE LAKE: So that is a great question. The answer I'm going to give you is not that I'm aware of at this point, but I'll have to follow up with you. Jamie are you aware? No. Sorry, Andrew, we'll come back to you. Not that I'm aware of, but that -- it's a good, but nevertheless, quite detailed question.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, operator. Thank you very much. Welcome, everybody, to our fourth-quarter call. I just want to start by telling you that Doug Braunstein won't be doing this call. I just want to thank him for his service to the Company. I do want to remind people, in spite of the fact that the whale happened during that time, during that time, we also had three record years of net income and something we all are very proud of this Company. And so Doug, thank you for your service if you are listening. And we are thrilled to have Marianne here. Marianne, some of you may know, but Marianne has extensive experience in accounting, numbers. She was the Controller of the investment bank for several years, so she knows the investment banking wholesale side pretty cold. She was also the CFO of the consumer side, so uniquely she has got deep experience in both parts of the Company. And so I'm going to turn it over to Marianne. We are thrilled to have you here. She's going to take you through the numbers and then we will take any and all time you need to answer your questions as usual. The only point before we start is I think the numbers here are really good. I mean look at the underlying detail of this Company, the third year, record income, 15% returns on tangible capital and growth in virtually every single business. And some negatives like NIM and stuff like that, which will, over time, reverse. So Marianne, let me turn it over to you and just take it through the details.
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. This is Marianne. I am going to take you through the presentation this morning, which is available on our website. I refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements, which is at the back of the presentation. And just before we turn to earnings, we also announced today the completion of the Board review of CIO and the management task force report. Both reports are available on our website. So with that, we will turn to page 1. The firm generated net income of $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.39 a share, on revenue of $24.4 billion, up 10% year-on-year and down 6% quarter-on-quarter. And on the page, you see we had a few significant items for the quarter and these (technical difficulty) offset each other and we will go through them as we go through the presentation. But what you don't see on the page is we also had a number of smaller items, many of which we will mention when we go through. For example, we made a contribution to our foundation and realized some securities gains this quarter. These smaller items also largely offset slightly to the negative. So for the full year, we generated record net income of $21.3 billion, or $5.20 a share, on revenue of $100 billion, flat year-over-year. Return on tangible common equity was 15% for both the quarter and the year and in fact, as Jamie said, this is the third consecutive year of both record net income and 15% return on tangible common equity. And before I turn to the businesses, I would characterize the overall performance of the quarter as strong performance across our businesses and highlight four themes. First, the positive trends in marketshare that we have been seeing continued this quarter. Year-over-year, we saw strong consumer deposit growth of 10%, mortgage origination volumes up 33% and sales volume in card up 9%. Also, the number one ranking in global IB fees, including record debt underwriting fees, record assets under custody in CIB, record revenue in Commercial Banking and record revenue in AUM in Asset Management. Second, we continued to see positive year-over-year loan growth. On a reported basis, the total loans for the Company were up 1%, while excluding runoff portfolios, our core loan growth was 9% with record loan balances in Commercial Banking up 14%, record Business Banking loan balances up 7% and record Asset Management loan balances of $80 billion. Third, strong credit performance continued in our wholesale portfolios, as well as in the core consumer portfolios, which have stabilized at low levels of charge-off and delinquency. The real estate portfolios continue to show improvement as the housing market continues to recover, but losses are still high. So finally, we continue to strengthen our capital position and you can see that if you turn to page 4 and I will take you there. We ended the year with Basel I and Basel III Tier 1 common of $140 billion and $144 billion respectively, both up $5 billion this quarter. And we had strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 11% and 8.7% respectively. And to note, the estimate for Basel III of 8.7% includes the full impact of MPR as we understand it compared to 8.4% last quarter and is approximately 150 basis points over last year on a comparable basis. The return on Basel I RWA was 1.9% for the quarter ex-DBA. And we added a few points to the bottom of the slide, which we think are important and we will spend some time at Investor Day going through our balance sheet in more detail, but just some salient points. You can see we have $450 billion of equity and long-term debt, under $100 billion of short-term debt, which is small relative to our $700 billion of cash, high-quality securities and secured financing and finally, deposits of $1.2 trillion, which fund our $700 billion of loans. So turning onto the businesses, if you move to page 5, Consumer & Community Banking, this includes our Consumer & Business Banking, Mortgage Banking, Card and Auto businesses. There's some facts here that show the strength of our Consumer franchise. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2 billion of net income for the quarter on $12 billion of revenue. We have the number one ATM network and the number two branch network with a 150 new branches this year. We're the number two mortgage originator and number one card issuer in the US and ended the year with over 100,000 Chase Private Clients in over 1200 locations. And we have over 31 million active online and 12 million active mobile customers. And just another thing that we are particularly proud of this year is a new accomplishment. We achieved the number one ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index Survey for customer satisfaction among large banks. In the appendix, we included a page on Hurricane Sandy, which I won't take you through, but it was amazing to see how our employees rallied to support our customers and while the financial impact wasn't significant of the firm, the impact we were able to have on our customers was significant. So onto page 6, Consumer & Business Banking. You can see net income of $756 million on revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year and sequentially. We continue to see pressure on deposit margins, 12 basis points in the quarter and 32 year-on-year, which negatively impacts NII, but this continues to be largely offset by deposit growth. We are growing customer deposits at more than twice the industry average, 10% year-on-year. And also in December, we saw the lowest customer attrition rate we have seen in the last 10 years and if you take that together with the customer satisfaction results I mentioned earlier, it speaks to the great progress we are making on the customer experience. We are deepening relationships with averages balances per account up, customer satisfaction up, transaction per debit card up, active online and mobile customers up. And just two more revenue drivers this quarter. We had record business banking loan balances of $18.9 billion with a strong pipeline and investment sales up almost 50% year-on-year with client investment assets up 15%. And almost two-thirds of these sales are managed accounts, which generate a strong recurring source of revenue for this business. Expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter and up slightly year-on-year driven by new branch builds. Mortgage Banking on page 7, the overall net income for the mortgage bank was $418 million and there are a couple of significant items here this quarter, which I will take you through as we go through the results. Moving up to the top and production, production pretax income of $789 million on strong originations of $51 billion, up 33% year-on-year and 8% in the quarter, which reflected strong refi activity, as well as an increase in correspondence. And although margins remain elevated, as we expected, we did see compression this quarter relative to the peaks of last quarter and we do expect them to continue to normalize into 2013. Production expense this quarter includes a litigation expense, which is a part of the significant item for mortgage-related matters that we had on page 1. Agency repurchased demand and the outstanding pipeline were both down significantly this quarter and cure rates improved driving lower losses, which resulted in a net positive $53 million for the quarter. So on Servicing, net servicing results in the portfolio at the end of the quarter include the impact of the acquisition of $70 billion of MetLife servicing and just a reminder, it closed late in the quarter. It is high-quality agency servicing with the added benefit of additional HARP opportunity for us. Looking at Servicing expense, you can see it includes the net charge for the IFR settlement of about $700 million, which is the balance of the significant items for mortgage-related matters. And just finally on this page, real estate portfolios, you can see pretax income of $812 million, including net charge-offs of $417 million. Charge-offs for the quarter were positively impacted by adjustments relating to Chapter 7 loans that we wrote down last quarter. And if you back those adjustments out, charge-offs would have been about $520 million this quarter versus $600 million last on an equivalent basis. And the improvement was driven by lower home-equity delinquencies. Looking at the whole year, we saw significant improvement in charge-offs driven by a 20% to 30% decline in delinquencies and to a lesser extent improving house prices. We expect these positive trends to continue next year, but not necessarily at the same pace as this. And given these trends, we released $700 million of loan-loss reserves this quarter, which is also a significant item. And going forward, you can expect quarterly net charge-offs of $550 million plus or minus going forward. On page 8, we will talk to you for a minute on the IFR settlement. The settlement requires us to make a cash payment of about $750 million and also provide modifications, short sales and other relief commitments of $1.2 billion. In terms of the earnings impact, we are booking a current period charge, but we are going to see significant future run rate savings and here is how you can think about it. In 2012, our run rate expense for the IFR was between $100 million and $150 million a quarter and we expect this to continue at these levels or even higher throughout 2013. These costs will now be eliminated almost immediately and the remaining work completed by the end of the month. If you exclude both the net settlement costs and also the IFR run rate costs, our Servicing expenses would have been around $725 million this quarter, which is obviously still very high relative to our longer-term guidance of $300 million to $350 million a quarter, but we expect that to continue to trend down and we don't expect any additional costs associated with the settlement in 2013. We already have many programs in place to help borrowers and these are fully in our reserve. Moving on to Card, Merchant Services and Auto on page 9. Net income of $840 million, down 20% year-on-year and 12% quarter-on-quarter on revenue of $4.8 billion, flat year-on-year and up slightly quarter-on-quarter. We saw strong sales volume again in Card, up 9% year-on-year. The revenue rate you see of 12.82% reflects strong interchange revenue and merchant processing fees and low revenue reversals on strong credit performance and our merchant processing volumes were up 17% year-on-year. The net charge-off rate you see of 3.5% is down slightly quarter-on-quarter and down 79 basis points year-on-year and we believe we are at or near the bottom here. We took no reserve actions this quarter, but there may be some additional reserve releases in the first half of 2013. On Auto, originations up 12% year-on-year, but down 13% quarter-on-quarter due to seasonality. And a final note on expenses, our fourth-quarter expenses were elevated due to the impairment of an asset related to a nonstrategic partnership. Slide 10 and 11, and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Strong results here for a fourth quarter, net income of $2 billion on revenue of $7.6 billion for the quarter, which included DVA of $567 million, which is in the credit adjustment line item. And for clarity going forward, in addition to DVA, this line item will also include CVA and related hedges. So if you focus on the numbers ex-DVA, $2.4 billion of net income on $8.2 billion of revenue, up 19% year-on-year and down 4% quarter-on-quarter. And just a reminder, our new reporting here reflects how we manage our clients. The traditional banking relationships are in banking and investor clients in market and investment services and we will talk more about these segments at Investor Day. Total banking revenue of $3.2 billion is up 29% year-on-year driven by higher IB fees of $1.7 billion in the quarter, up over 50% year-on-year, making this the strongest fee quarter this year and including record debt underwriting fees. Total markets and investor services revenue of $5 billion, up 14% year-on-year, driven by markets revenue of $4.1 billion, up 19% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter. And just to remind you, this is in line with the better end of guidance we gave you at Goldman Sachs. It was a solid quarter for Fixed Income, up 21% year-on-year, down 15% quarter-on-quarter across products. Reminder, the impact of the remaining synthetic credit portfolio is included here in the Fixed Income result and was a modest loss again this quarter. Progress continued to be made derisking this position. Equity markets of $895 million, up 11% year-on-year, down 14% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential change was primarily due to seasonally slower equity derivatives with CapEx [piece] holding up well. So just moving onto drivers and at the bottom, you can see our average CIB VAR declined to $106 million this quarter, which is a significant reduction and although it is not on the page on a spot basis, VAR declined even further reflecting lower volatility in the look-back period and also the risk reduction in synthetic credit. We also had record assets under custody of $18.8 trillion, up 12% on the year and record (inaudible) revenues. The comp to revenue ratio ex-DVA for the whole business was 27% for the quarter and 32% for the year and both for the quarter and the year, comp to revenue ratios both including and excluding DVA were basically the same for TSS, the IB and CIB. And going forward, we expect the combined business comp to revenue to be 35% plus or minus. And just a comment on credit. Trends are stable at low levels and provisions this quarter benefited from recoveries and a reduction in the allowance related to restructured nonperforming loans. On page 11, just before we leave CIB, there's a few metrics. Number one rank in global IB fees, number one fixed income markets revenue share through the third quarter of this year, number one ranking from institutional investor for all American fixed income and equity research and we have also made progress on our international expansion in the last couple of years. International loans and assets under custody up 50% and 33% respectively since 2010 and almost half of the revenue this year for CIB was international. Commercial Banking on page 12. This year was the third consecutive year of record revenue and net income for this business. The quarter saw net income of $692 million, up 8% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter on record revenue on $1.7 billion and record loan balances. (inaudible) data shows we are growing our loan balances faster than the industry average with C&I loan growth up 18% and record middle-market loan balances for the 11th consecutive quarter up 14%. We continue to see competitive pricing pressure, but spreads remained stable this quarter and lastly, we continue to see strong credit performance this quarter. Asset management, page 13. Continued strong investment performance and long-term inflows drove the third consecutive year of record revenue. For the quarter, net income of $483 million, up 60% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter on record revenue of $2.8 billion. Total results this quarter driven by higher performance fees and improving markets and net inflows of $32 billion driving AUM growth. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows for this business. Other positive trends included loan growth up $20 billion year-on-year driven by both mortgage and international growth and average deposits of $134 billion, up 10%. Expenses up 11% year-on-year due to higher comp expense, but the pretax margin of 29% was also up. Moving on to page 14 and Corporate and Private Equity, overall net income of close to $500 million for the quarter included private equity net income of $50 million principally from gains on sale. Treasury and CIO had a net loss of $157 million, which included negative NII due to the low rate environment and limited reinvestment opportunities, which was partially offset by about $200 million of net securities gains and mark to market. Excluding these gains, treasury and CIO's net loss was about $300 million, in line with our guidance and we are continuing to guide to a net loss of $300 million plus or minus. And finally, other corporate, net income here of just over $600 million includes $620 million of tax adjustments, which is our final significant item. It resulted from a reduction in tax rate for the full year and also a number of discrete items, most significantly a tax return adjustment. And although large, these items are not unusual. The tax adjustments were partially offset by $184 million of additional litigation reserves and again, if I adjust for the two items I just mentioned, other corporate net income would have been about $100 million and we continue to expect it to run at that level, $100 million plus or minus, going forward. And remember, both treasury CIO and other corporate results are likely to vary quarter-on-quarter. Moving on to net interest margin, turn to page 15. You can see firmwide NIM declined 3 basis points and core NIM 7 basis points in the quarter. Of note, our NII held up this quarter and in fact, it grew despite this compression. There is obviously a number of items affecting NIM. First, the negative. Competitive pressure and the runoff of higher-yielding loans drove lower loan yields across the board. Lower rates in Europe drove lower investment security yields and the low rate environment continued to impact reinvestment opportunities. And on the positive, increased hedging and a change in mix reduced the cost of our long-term debt. Hedge accounting had a neutral impact on NIM this quarter with some offsets in assets and liabilities and going forward, given the environment, we continue to expect modest pressure on NIM for the next several quarters. So just turning on page 16, our final page, the outlook, we have covered most of these items already and we will provide more detail on our outlook at Investor Day, but we remain optimistic about 2013 and the continuation of marketshare gains, positive loan growth and improving credit trends all contributing to our results. So thank you for joining us and with that, we will open up the call to Q&A. Questions and Answers
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, we obviously have to make some assumptions going forward in house prices and they are not that different than the assumptions you would see in most other that get published by Case-Shiller, etc. Right now, they have a modest increase in home prices in 2013 and '14. I will stick with just those two years. But if it was 5% better than that, which is possible, that would run through our books in lower charge-offs and lower reserves. And just as a rule of thumb, $500 million for one year.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a very rough rule of thumb.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, no, we are required under Dodd-Frank to disclose our stress tests. Remember, we do -- in March. We do it almost immediately after the Fed's report. And remember, we do hundreds. The Fed is four. So we look at multiple kind of stress tests and we are going to try to give you a full view of how we look at the Company under stress. I should point out that a lot of you did it yourselves in the past. You were pretty accurate some of you.
JAMIE DIMON: Just to give you a view, we have $200 billion of equity and $250 billion of unsecured debt. That is $450 billion. That is a lot of capital before anyone else bears a loss. It is not clear to me that subordinated versus just unsecured, and it would take time to develop those markets. If a bank has 50/50 or -- obviously it changes the nature a little bit over time, so it will take time to develop. But I think we're working with the authorities to get it right, to do the analysis right, to have the right numbers. I think you have a little time before someone says it has to be this amount. Remember, we have got Basel I, Basel II, Basel III, OLA, LCR NSF and the new one and we are going to be able to accommodate all of them. It will take a little bit of time. I do want to point out that we fully intend in 2013, late 2013, to be a 9.5% Basel III and to be fully compliant with LCR.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, we had done giving you some numbers in our annual report last year about where it is a no-brainer to buy back stock, which I said is tangible book value. Tangible book value is now $38 or $39, which has gone up, what is it, $4 this year, almost $5 this year. So we still think if you haircut earnings and buy stuck at these prices, it's probably still a good deal. We got permission to buy back $3 billion in the first quarter. Obviously, it is going to be a little price-sensitive and then CCAR will set what we can buy back for the next four quarters after that. I hope that answers your -- yes.
JAMIE DIMON: You can do the same numbers at today's prices. Discount, if you want to be conservative, discount earnings, buy back stock. At the end of a two or three-year period, you will apply earnings per share and higher tangible book value per share even at these prices. It seems like a pretty good deal to me. Typically, you have a good company.
JAMIE DIMON: And you are not going to need the capital down the road. I am not talking about for one year, but down the road.
MARIANNE LAKE: Think about it as all in and we are expecting our run rate in the future to be I think $300 million to $350 million, as I said, excluding the items we talked about. Including IFR, we are at $725 million. We have got a ways to go, but it is coming down. Think about it in there.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I think let me just put out first off that our comp ratio was 33%. If you, by the way, if you added back some of the bonuses paid in corporate that don't show up as comp in the IB, it would be like 35%. We think that the roundest number is kind of an ongoing run rate. We have formulas. We don't pay out necessarily by the formula, but we have formulas that are capital-adjusted, risk-adjusted, etc., etc. that -- that is what really guides it and it is not -- so it is really done at a much more detailed level than it will bounce around that 35%. I should point out that again we feel good that our ROE in the investment bank was 17% this year. It was 16% or 17% last year and the year before and we are paying our people fair and well. I feel good about that. That is a good thing. That is a good business model to have something like that.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I think that is probably true, but other firms have ratios of 50%, 55%. Ours is already fairly low. We want to win in the business. We are going to be competitive in compensation and obviously that will adjust over time as competition changes.
JAMIE DIMON: At Investor Day, we will try to give you a better view of that. So there are clearly some negatives and we don't know all the rules, also some positives. So we are in a position between custody and clearing and our brokers businesses to provide some of those services for investors so they can allocate capital properly, transform the collateral and serve them better. So let the rules come out. Obviously, this is going to affect our revenues a bit, but there will be opportunities there too.
JAMIE DIMON: No, here is my caveat. We are going to meet LCR this year whatever it is. It doesn't matter to us whether we like it or not. Now to answer your question, there were some changes in LCR; I think they were good, but they still capped the benefit like mortgages and we have like almost $90 billion of MBS. So government-guaranteed MBS is in what they call level 2 and therefore, you are restricted in how much [capital] liquidity. Now personally I think that is wrong, but it is okay. We will live with it, we are moving on. I don't know why the American regulators would agree to that. Government-guaranteed MBS in a market you want where they treated liquid and remember, they already have a 15% haircut. I could argue they don't need any haircut, but look, whether changes are made or not, we are going to be compliant. It is not going to affect our earnings that much.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so hey, Betsy, we talked about the third quarter being -- peaking at over 200 basis points before the margins compress in some 40 or so basis points in the quarter and we do expect that to continue into 2013, not at that level. If you go back in time, you would see gain-on-sale margins more in the 65 basis points. I don't know if that is where it will end, but certainly we expect for that to be seen through 2013, but with gaining marketshare. We hope to keep our volumes up.
JAMIE DIMON: Obviously, it will normalize over time, but it may not go that low because our expenses could also be permanently higher. To be in the business is going to cost more money and obviously that will be part of your -- what you have to earn back.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so we -- the number that Marianne showed you is the Basel III Tier 1 common 8.7. If you look at what I call for the next two years passive mitigation, that is run-off and what I call normal models, so we still have to get certain models in there and there is not arguing with anybody, it's just models that should be put in place, that would add almost 1% to Basel right off the bat. About I am going to say $100 billion of that would be models, $80 billion to $100 billion would be models. Part of that is the runoff to synthetic credit, which is obviously coming down over time. And the other thing, which I think you're going to see, is we are pushing Basel III down, we have, but we are pushing it down at a very detailed level. I think over time you're going to see (inaudible) down capital Basel RWA even more. And there are things in Basel, which I don't know what the future portends. We have $200 billion plus of operational RWA in there now. That is driven very -- that is like $16 billion of capital. That is driven very high by obviously the mortgage litigation and stuff like that, some of which will go away. So one day, a lot -- that $200 million should come down a lot too. I just don't know the timetable for that.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I didn't mention -- we are going to get there late in 2013 whatever it takes.
JAMIE DIMON: We will answer -- to give you more feedback -- maybe we have to have a buffer. We don't know what the final rules are for capital. So you already have a conservation buffer. You go below what happens. Obviously, OCI could be a big swing. Like if you model -- I forgot -- we had modeled it. Like 300 basis points would be $20 billion after tax or something like that. But you could handle that too because it is going to come in over time and you can manage your balance sheet going forward, your stock buyback going forward. So we really need to see the future rules to make that determination. If we need a buffer, we will have a buffer.
JAMIE DIMON: Whatever that is, we will go there right away too, but we just don't know what it is yet. And we don't know whether CCAR is going to drive capital or the conservation buffer is going to drive capital or whatever. And we don't know how the G-SIFI exactly works, even though we know it's a 2.5%. We will probably find ways to reduce that over time. So we have plenty of capital. Right now, I am -- far more than I personally think we need, but we have plenty of capital.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, unfortunately, that is a one-year thing, okay and I should point out that before you ask is that when we started the dividends, we said that the intent would be to increase them a little bit every year, so you should expect to see that. We are going to ask for less capital return from stock buyback than we have in the past so where I can do $3 billion in the first quarter. We are going to do less because we have determined, and this is a Board-level determination too, that we want to get to 9.5% quicker and we don't exactly know how these stress tests work. So we think under severe stress, we would have plenty of capital, but the last time the Fed's numbers were very different. We don't understand that and the way CCAR has done this year has even more volatility. Basel 2.5 is far more volatile in how you calculate RWA, OCI and all that than the old Basel I test. So we are a little cautious, which I think is what obviously the Fed expected people to do.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, let me just separate the two. In Consumer, credit card is near the end. There could be more, but it is near the end. It's really mortgage. Mortgage reserves are going to have to come down as charge-offs come down and charge-offs are going to come down. We are not trying to manipulate our earnings or anything like that. They are going to come down. The portfolios are smaller; housing prices are going up. We just don't know exactly the pace they are going to come down, but remember they are half what they were a year and a half ago and my guess is, in a year and a half to two from now, they will be half of what they are today, which implies the reserves will come down. We have $5 billion left; that implied would be $2.5 billion. So nothing magical there. That is what is in the numbers. It is really a matter of timing, etc. On the CIB side, it was really -- we had one or two big recoveries, so we did have, what was it, $400 million, but Marianne also pointed out there were some other negatives that got booked in CIB too. So you are right; we are not going to have much reserve takedown in CIB, but the other negatives won't be there either. So it is a little bit of a wash in CIB too from other non-reserve-related stuff.
JAMIE DIMON: I wouldn't call it a strong fourth-quarter showing. We kind of made an assumption that the last two weeks of the year are pretty dead in terms of activity and we were a little bit wrong about that. But here is what I would say. Activity now is continuing; it is usually strong in the first part of the year. We don't know. But I personally believe that this has been, and I have been consistent about this, a cyclical, a secular change. We deal with 16,000 investors. Investable assets are going up; they are not going down. Global trade is going up; it is not going down. High net worth assets, I'm talking over 10 years and so there is a need that people have to buy and sell securities, etc. So I think the underlying trend is up and obviously spreads will compress over time. They have by the way for 20 years. That will continue. And now we have got a bunch of model changes, not models, but like business model changes from swaps and derivatives and regulations. We will adjust all that, but there is a chance you're going to wake up one day and it will be a boomer year and no one is going to predict that either. There is a chance we happen to go into recession that it will get worse, but my attitude is I think we are very well-positioned in the business. It is very broad-based between FX rates, credits, securitized products, commodities. It is very global, emerging markets driven by research, which Marianne mentioned we are number one. So over time, it will grow. I just can't predict what it is going to do next quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. Look, I think the American economy -- I've said the table is rather well set. Consumers, businesses, housing, small business they are all in pretty good shape and I think we need good policy and good fiscal policy, but yes, so we expect to see -- we have had, which I think you mentioned, we have had run-off in consumer too. Remember, in Card, from (inaudible) and some other stuff and we are running off sort of businesses and certain things we got out of, but you could start to see a little bit of growth now going forward in outstandings. Good growth in spending, a little bit of growth in outstandings.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, hey, John, we will do that for you at our Investor Day in a lot of detail. I think the way to think about our adjusted expenses going forward, you should think about them being flat to down in terms of direction and we will go through all of that for you in February.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, around $50 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: One day we hope.
MARIANNE LAKE: (multiple speakers). So we don't -- yes, we won't -- we can't predict the litigation expense, I'm sorry.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the one part, which I just want to reiterate, is that obviously that one is going to be lumpy and be ongoing except the part relating to mortgages. We have done a lot of work on and we are hoping that we are properly reserved there and they are not going to see duplication of that. In the last couple of years of litigation, a lot of it related to mortgages. Not all of it, but a lot of it.
JAMIE DIMON: You have got me there. I think if we buy back $3 billion and what we issue -- I think we issue -MARIANNE LAKE: 2.5.
JAMIE DIMON: -- amortizes in over time as we issue it -MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: -- so my guess is it will go down a little bit in the first quarter. When you issue restricted stock, it doesn't immediately go into fully diluted. That goes in as it amortizes. Remember this stuff amortizes over three years generally.
JAMIE DIMON: If we spend the whole $3 billion, my guess is it will go down, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I think, John, in part, that is it. I can get back to you with more specific details. It did come down slightly in the quarter. It does reflect the combination of our full understanding of all of the rules, plus some model changes and everything else in the quarter and BAU activity, but we can get you more detail.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, well, so we are continuing to grow our deposits very strongly. We are continuing to grow our loans very strongly, so core loan growth up 9%. So all in all, we are generally holding pace with NIM compression and hope to see the same next year plus or minus.
JAMIE DIMON: It was better by over $100 million versus the fourth quarter last year.
JAMIE DIMON: Of course, last year wasn't particularly good by the way.
JAMIE DIMON: Completely off. Let me tell you where - you raised a lot of subjects; let me do them one by one. Obviously, when you have a problem like the whale, you have mistakes, which you should acknowledge and then fix. So we obviously fixed CIO totally 100%. People in it, reporting, risk, controls, committees, guidelines and we don't do synthetic credit there at all. But some of those mistakes obviously scared us and we went and checked everywhere in the Company. So we are fixing certain things across the Company. Not that they are bad, they are not disasters, but they require fixing. And so when you have an accident like that, you want to say we are going to use this to get stronger, better, smarter, tougher. And we have to and we are going to. Obviously you can't meet every demand of the regulators. So we have got real resources doing it. We have already done a lot of it. We are going to continue to do more. So yes, they were changes from the whale. Number two, we are in business to build the business over time by serving clients. That is what we do. We do it every -- we take risk. When you take risks, you make loans; you take risks when you invest money; you take risk when you build systems and branches. But that is what we have been doing consistently and I hope you see in the underlying numbers more branches, more bankers, more custody, more trading, more products, more services, more countries, happier clients in every business. Record results in Commercial Banking, Asset Management, a lot of cross-sell in that and we are going to do a lot more to describe to you the competitive benefits that we get in this Company because the different business units work together and things like that. So that part of the business hasn't changed. That is why we are here. Even CIO has always been doing that, investing assets conservatively because I was watching something on TV today -- you have to earn a return on your assets. The book -- you are not going to try to earn a return on your assets is ludicrous to me and to manage asset liability exposure generally conservatively. We obviously made a mistake. And the third thing, the reorganization, that was around -- and I (inaudible) do a lot of this for you, around the client. If you said rebuild the Company from the ground up, you probably would have organized it around the clients, not necessarily by product. It is not that we were bad or banks were bad or anything like that; it is that companies acquired mortgage companies, they acquired credit card companies, they acquired retail branches. The power of that franchise is extraordinary. 40% of our retail branches own credit cards -- are credit cards today. A big chunk of our mortgage sales come out of the branches. Most of our small businesses serve out of the branches. Middle-market is served out of the branches. The branches are becoming an enormous competitive advantage for asset management. The commercial bank couldn't survive without them. So all we did is say put together those businesses under one roof where you want to have -- you want to treat the client the way they want to be treated when they come in the front door. Same thing for CIB, the same client set in the investor side and the issuer side, the corporate side. So we go to any country. We serve the big companies, we serve the sovereign wealth funds, we serve the governments. We serve them out of TSS and we serve them out of the investment bank. All we are doing here is better coordination, which we think will have more cross-sell and believe it or not lower expenses. Plus it will help us deal with the new regulatory environment. So both of these things are going to help us deal with the new regulatory environment to have consistent standards across all the businesses, etc. So that is why we had the reorg. And management changes, you went through the litany of changes, but just remember Daniel Pinto has been in that business his whole life. Mike Cavanagh has been here for many years and was already running TS&S. Doug Petno has been running the Commercial Bank for several years now. Gordon Smith and Todd Maclin, we did it a little bit faster than we told people. We told people we were going to put that under one roof. Marianne Lake has been the Controller of the IB and the CFO of the consumer bank. All the people in these jobs have been here a long time and they are very good. I mean I think it is an exceptional management team. It is too much turnover, but again the way I look at the turnover, if I have 15 people in the operating committee, you should assume that 15% to 20% every year will turn over. Some years will be zero and some years will be more. When you have reorgs and stuff like that, it is a little bit more. Hopefully, you're going to have stability. We have got a great management team. They are working a lot of different things. Most have been here a long time. And part of it, part of it relates to -- remember if you were on my Board of Directors, you would be asking me, in fact instructing me to make sure you were putting in place in big jobs the people who have to be tested to see if they can do my job. That is -- I mentioned this many years ago, that is job number one. That takes precedence over all other things. And sometimes it leads to turnover. I'm sorry.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, look, you should get to know them, but you could evaluate their quality, their integrity, their brains. Mary Erdoes has been here a long time. Matt Zames, who is now Co-Chief Operating -- Frank Bisignano both been here a long time. So these are long tenured, very good, respected employees. And so I know it is going to work. Obviously, you have to make that evaluation yourself.
JAMIE DIMON: Not really, but the CCAR does have this qualitative aspect, which I don't exactly know what that means, but not really. It really related more to the desire -- the stock price is higher and the desire to get to 9.5% quicker. Everyone's being doing it and obviously we shouldn't lag. That's all.
JAMIE DIMON: Also, Mike (inaudible) because you had me do a little work after one of your reports came out about stock price. So do this yourself. Take Bank One's stock price from the day before I got there to today, and take JPMorgan's stock price from the day we announced the deal to today, compare it to the S&P, the bank, the bank index or all other major firms and it's actually rather good. It outperformed in both cases, the bank by a long shot. In both cases, the S&P not by a long shot but by a significant margin and almost most other financial companies. So obviously something has been working a little bit here. Opportunity, I think the opportunities are fabulous. So next year, we are going to focus a tremendous amount of regulatory requirements, these consent orders getting things done, but also just organic growth. Small business, Marianne mentioned, is up almost everywhere, partially in Florida and California where WaMu gave us the opportunity to do that. We opened our 1000th branch in California. We are still going to open net over 100 branches this year. Our credit card has been growing. The Chase Private Client, we have got 250 branches to 1200 Chase Private Client. That number is going to go up -- and I don't know if we've -- I don't know if that is public -- okay, now it's public -- to something like 2000 end of next year. It is really working. So it is growing dramatically. Our mutual fund complex has been growing. TS&S, actually not TS&S, the Global Corporate Bank has opened multiple branches overseas. We have gone from 120 Global Corp bankers to 286 or something. It is going to be north of 300 and it is working. If you look at Investment Banking revenues out of the commercial bank, when we first got here, I think it was like $450 million. This year, it hit almost $2 billion and we think the opportunity to continue to grow is large. So in almost every single business, we see very good opportunities to grow and obviously, we operate in a difficult world, the financial services, but in the Investment Bank, it was -- it has been -- Marianne went through the numbers, but we don't see why we can't continue to grow that around the world and serve more clients in more places like Colombia or in some of the emerging markets. In Commercial Banking, we opened branches in non -- states we don't have branches, which have been focused on kind of larger clients and international. That is working well. International commercial bank is working well and all these numbers are in here. You guys should go through it soon. They are all pretty good and you are going to see us continue to focus on growing those businesses in a quality way.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I think you should look at it -- we are already fully engaged in meeting all of those concents and other regulatory demands. Remember, we have changing rules and requirements. We also have a lot of items that the regulators have asked us to focus on, their consent orders. So yes, it is a tremendous amount of resource, but it is not going to change the numbers you see. It is just the people involved -- a lot of people involved in risk credit, legal compliance, audit, HR all are really involved in getting a lot of this stuff right and we have to do that. Of course and people in the business too of course.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, Matt, you would have seen that we pretty much portfolio all the jumbos we originate right now. We price them to great returns and we would continue to do that. We like that asset. I think overall across the firm, we did $5 billion of jumbos this quarter and so you should expect to see that continue.
JAMIE DIMON: I would just add that one of the things you learn to live with a little bit is that you could put a mortgage on your balance sheet and earn or 3.75% or 4% if it is a jumbo or something like that. It doesn't have OCI. It holds more capital, but it might be a wiser thing to do than taking the gain on sale and then buying an MBS at 2.25%. So there are all these opportunities to think through how to manage in the new world properly both for the client and for the shareholder. (multiple speakers). Go ahead.
JAMIE DIMON: It may be -- and that may change over time and get bigger. So we are doing a little bit more and right now, it is the jumbos. We have done a little bit like C pluses and stuff like that, but there may be others.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the QM was a really big start and kind of well thought through, but it also needs to be coordinated with Basel III, some of these NPR rules, this whole thing about OCI. So all these things are going to affect mortgage a little bit and a lot of players involved in that who have to coordinate it. But I do think over time they will open up the mortgage markets. How rep and warranty is going to be handled, etc.
JAMIE DIMON: TRN, skin in the game. I think securitization will be important. So if I was the government, I would want to get QRM and securitization rules fixed as quickly as I can to allow people to start.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say that is probably in line with that. We have excess cash and excess capacity at central banks and that is what that reflects.
JAMIE DIMON: They are two different numbers, but they move in the same direction. And we will probably disclose more about that at the Investor Day too.
MARIANNE LAKE: We will.
JAMIE DIMON: Probably not much.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, not much.
JAMIE DIMON: The average yield in the investment portfolio is coming down a little bit every quarter and that will continue for a while.
MARIANNE LAKE: No.
JAMIE DIMON: We do break it out.
MARIANNE LAKE: We disclosed it. We haven't disclosed it in the fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: What was it last time?
MARIANNE LAKE: Probably like 3.
JAMIE DIMON: Interest duration. So it is probably about the same.
JAMIE DIMON: The other thing -- right, but the important -- I think the way to look at (inaudible), we would benefit from rising rates. So I've always said that that portfolio is subordinated to the interest of the Company. It is very short. You can extend that duration or a lot more income, but then we would be hurt by rising rates and we break out the earnings and risk from rising rates -- if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points, it is about a $2 billion plus pretax. And that comes through the investment portfolio and loan repricing, etc.
JAMIE DIMON: I can't -- offhand, it is hard for me to say that, but I think I am going to guess, but like 30 or 40
JAMIE DIMON: -- to eliminate -- right, something like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: The margin?
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think it is in the supplement. I am afraid I --.
JAMIE DIMON: It's in the production revenue.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's in production revenue, which I think was close to $800 million.
MARIANNE LAKE: Revenue was 3%, 3.5% and net was -- (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: So it's like 3.5 times 50, actually is on closed, not --.
MARIANNE LAKE: We will do the math for you.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, it is a Board-level decision and in some ways, it is a nice problem to have, but the way you set the question up you almost have no option. You can't buy back stock and you can't raise your dividend. All you have left is something like that. So we will get there when we get there. Again, we need to see all the new rules and how they are going to apply like this conservation buffer and we may know more by Investor Day, but when we know more, we will let you know.
JAMIE DIMON: So the first one is obviously we do budgets and stuff. We put targets in place, things we would like to accomplish. So that is in how we look at -- we are not going to disclose it to you. But I did say that we do think it is going to enhance revenues and reduce expenses a little bit. So a little bit is in there for the CIB and a little bit in there for consumer. And we are going to disclose more at Investor Day about kind of cross-sell and how we look at it and where we think we can benefit, etc. And if you look at risk-weighted assets, we are up to -- our balance sheet is $2.4 trillion. We have got $200 billion of money deposited in central banks around the world or in repo, very short-term investments, $350 billion in AA securities and $400 billion in securities borrowed or resales. We have a really, really liquid balance sheet. I just mentioned $750 billion, almost $1 trillion of very short-term stuff that is sitting there on our balance sheet in the asset side and our risk-weighted assets are now $1.65 trillion. They have gone up dramatically because of Basel 2.5, the fact that we don't have certain models in place that will be accepted. So some of the benefit arguably is going to be just -- I am going to call it run-off. Some is from models that regulators expect people to design and put in place that we don't have yet. We just don't have the history or we haven't done the modeling and that is -- a lot of it is around credit-related, synthetic credit type stuff, securitizations and things like that. So we are going to put those in place. And that is not arguing with regulators; they would expect us to do that over time. Obviously, regulators -- I know they are going to look at how people do models around the world and they want this done fairly, etc.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sure. So think about repurchase. So both sides of that we do them separately. So repurchase losses, I told you you will see demand down significantly, you will see the outstanding pipeline down significantly. We have seen cure rates improve and so our realized losses were sub $200 million and it is what it is and it is a factor, a feature of activity obviously and it can vary a little. On the repurchase reserve side, it is obviously model-driven and we use inputs, including things like cure rates. So it is not going to be a perfect offset in this quarter. It happened to be slightly more and over time, over the next few quarters, we think they could largely offset that you might see some small pluses and minuses.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, and I would say we are in constant dialogue with the agencies and obviously people ask about behavior and we are in constant dialogue, we think we understand the direction it is going and we feel good about where we are right now and we will continue to monitor that.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know how to respond to that. I think -- maybe you can call later and get some more feedback on some of the stuff you said. You can call Sarah Youngwood at investor relations. But you went through a lot of the stuff that is accurate. Obviously we are in an environment -- the environment changes all the time, but we have growth plans everywhere. So it isn't like we are sitting on our laurels and just looking at what is going to -- NIM compression, stuff like that. So we expect to grow earnings next year. I may be wrong, but that is what we expect.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, okay.
JAMIE DIMON: You're welcome.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we had said earlier, on July 13, we hope it is almost a nonissue by the end of the year. I think we are getting there. I think from the day that -- and we are not going to give you more detail than what I am about to tell you so don't ask. We had modest losses in the fourth quarter. There is no reason to have any losses going forward. The risk from the date of the investment bank got and they have done a good job continuing to derisk it are down, I am going to say, another 50%. So obviously, there is still risk. It is still a portfolio which has got -- the average duration I am going to say is 2, 2.5 years left. So if you did nothing, it is going to diminish dramatically over time, but I think we have got it well-controlled at this point. There could be some volatility because of the nature of it. It has got some idiosyncratic exposures in there, but we think we are fine. We don't think there's anything that anyone needs to worry about anymore.
JAMIE DIMON: You have got to do it a little bit by business because I think in consumer mostly sticky, but it is probably a little bit of TAG -- like you guys had an estimate for that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, like (inaudible) plus or minus. Mostly those deposits we would consider core and sticky.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. And then TS&S is a lot of seasonal year-end deposits, so it bounces all over the place. Asset management I put in the sticky category. Commercial Bank has been kind of flat, but it is sticky.
JAMIE DIMON: It is flat because the loans are starting to grow and it is huge. Commercial has $190 billion of deposits. I think that number was $100 billion 3.5 years ago. So they have a lot of money there. We actually expect that might have come down one day as companies start to grow and expand more aggressively, which would be a good thing.
JAMIE DIMON: That's a woulda', shoulda', coulda'. I don't know, Guy, the answer to that question. I think if they had been put in place -- it depends how they would have ultimately been put in place. So they were delayed to get more work and how it gets done. I think if they had been put in place for JPMorgan where the rules constrained us overseas, but didn't constrain other companies overseas, we would be down from what we might now have. If the rules were put in place as we can compete freely in Frankfurt, London, Singapore and Shanghai, my guess is our US revenues would have been down a little bit, our international revenues would have been up a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: No, so private equity is $8 billion invested. We expect to earn a return on that. We are obviously getting a great return on it, so that is lumpy, but it should be more than $50 million on average. Treasury -- think of treasury as NII. It is very predictable. The NII (inaudible) by quarter. That number will go down a little bit. That is just how we allocate capital and funds between all the business units. And then how we invest the assets. So we can change that tomorrow by having longer duration in our investment portfolio. The lumpier part of treasury and CIO is when we have mark-to-market gains and securities gains. That bounces around a little bit and again some of that is discretionary. So we don't look at that -- we should almost call it a net loss, and that number -- I think the $300 million will come down over time, not go up for a whole bunch of different reasons, which I won't go through right now. And then the other corporate -- that has net allocations, BOLI, COLI, taxes, all these lumpy items and we will just try to tell you it should be plus 100 -- it could be on average 100, plus or minus a couple hundred because of lumpiness of those items. Like corporate taxes are lumpy for a whole bunch of different reasons and so our numbers would be 100 on average. And we always explain the difference if there is ever a big difference there.
JAMIE DIMON: It has got not a damned thing to do with exotic investment strategies, zero, nada, nothing, okay? The bulk of those assets are always invested conservatively, AA plus. We had to do it around the world, so deposits around the world, etc., nothing to do with that. It has all got to do with some of the NIM compression that shows up there because obviously investment portfolio yield has gone down a little over 2%. It was 4% three years ago and how we allocate capital and things like that. The changes you have seen. Some of them are the differences due to the regulatory changes of B3, RWA and stuff like that. So we will try to make this a little bit clearer going forward. But on average, that number will come down, not go up over time.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, when we allocate the new Basel III operational capital debt, the capital allocations will go up mostly to the CIB by I am going to say 20% or so and to the commercial bank by 20% or so or maybe a little bit more than that. And that will obviously change the return targets for those units. It will also be very healthy, so it will just come down. The Company will be exactly the same. I mean so we just have -- I think when we allocate all this stuff intelligently, it will actually probably end up driving better returns over time as people learn how to manage it a little bit differently. So we will be allocating -- again, it eventually will show more. We will be allocating out -- think of it as everything at one point, LCR, G-SIFI, Basel III, Basel II, whatever comes down the pike will be allocated out so our managers can manage through it.
JAMIE DIMON: And the other thing we haven't decided permanently is how you look at each business because my feeling has been, this is open for debate, is that the business should be capitalized the way its competitors are going to be capitalized so they would feel free -- they are free to compete in that category. I think the people lump their capital ratios around their competitors. That could be very hard for someone for example to be -- run with 7.5% capital and all their competitors are at 10% or vice versa.
JAMIE DIMON: No, cost is cost. It has nothing to do with that. I am talking about capital -- saying we may capitalize the commercial bank at 8.5% and the investment bank at 10%. It may not be 9.5% for everybody because they have to operate, they have to compete in different environments. So that is where you just -- we just haven't figured out exactly how to do that yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Folks, thank you for spending time with us. Marianne, great job. Folks, we will talk to you all soon. Thank you.",0.23,-0.25700000000000145,0,0.08086803710620272,0.1036382234105765
7,Q4_2013,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. So we start on Page 1. The Firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.30 a share with a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenues of $24 billion, down 1% year-on-year, and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. As you see, we had several significant items in the quarter, which I will review as we go through the presentation in more detail, but they include a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of Visa shares, and a $0.5 billion gain on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, both in the corporate segment; as well as a $0.8 billion pretax or a $1.1 billion after-tax impact of legal expense in the quarter, partly booked in mortgage with the remainder that's in corporate, principally the Madoff settlement recently announced; a $1.3 billion benefit from reduced loan loss reserves in consumer businesses. And then in addition, CIB's results for the quarter include a $2 billion loss for DVA and FVA, or funding valuation adjustments, which I'll also come back to in more detail. The total impact of these items is a negative $0.10 of EPS. So not to diminish their importance but to illustrate the strength of the core performance of the underlying businesses, if you do adjust our results for these items we would have earned $5.7 billion of net income, $1.40 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%. So talking about the full year, skipping over Page 2 and straight to Page 3, reported net income of nearly $18 billion or $4.35 a share on revenue of approximately $100 billion, and a return on tangible common equity reported of 11%. Again if you adjust it for all reported significant items in the year we would have earned net income of over $23 billion, $5.70 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%. Again, strong underlying performance for the full year. Of note, let me talk for a minute about adjusted expenses. You can see on the page that our adjusted expenses, that's excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure related matters, are a flat $60 billion. This is in line, albeit at the high end of our guidance of $59.5 billion to $60 billion for the year, but included in this number is a total of close to $1 billion of other non-corporate legal expense, which if we had adjusted would have left a more core number at just over $59 billion, despite the incremental investment in controls of a $1 billion we made in the year. So briefly recapping on 2013, clearly a year marked by regulated development and significant legal settlements; however, more importantly, also a year in which our businesses together and individually performed strongly. We succeeded in further progressing our customer satisfaction agenda and gaining market share across businesses. 2013 saw very strong credit performance across businesses, including significant improvements in mortgage, and finally we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and margins. So let's talk about capital on Page 4. So I'm not going to talk much about Basel I, except to say that you can see we progressed our ratio in the quarter to 10.7% Basel I Tier 1 common, but importantly if you look at the middle section, you see that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is 9.5%, meeting our year-end target. Just a few words on the component underlying this ratio. Three things. First, we generated approximately $5 billion of net capital in the quarter. Second, we also saw significant RWA benefits of model and parameter updates, including HPI and lower spreads, as well as portfolio run-off. And third, these positives together worth over 60 basis points of improvement were reduced by about 50 basis points due to higher levels of operational risk capital. The significant increase in operation risk capital this quarter is largely driven by the inclusion of the large legal expense from the prior quarter, and we will spend some more time on capital at Investor Day, but despite headwinds we still anticipate reaching 10% plus or minus Basel III Tier 1 common by the end of this year. So a quick update on leverage. Both the Firm-wide and the bank supplementary leverage ratio under US rules increased to 4.7%, and I'll come back on the next page to talk about the final Basel SLR framework that was issued this weekend. During the quarter, the Holding Company converted certain inter-Company debt at the bank into capital, improving the bank's relative ratios. We remain compliant with LCR at the Firm level this quarter, including the impact of the proposed new rules, and we continue to have about 19% available resources relative to risk-weighted assets at the end of the year. So before we move on, as you know, the Volcker rule was finalized in the quarter and having had the opportunity to consider the rule, some thoughts. So the certainty provided by having a final rule and the implementation date of July 2015 were welcome. It is a tough rule and the regulators have laid out stringent standards for compliance policies, procedures, controls, and testing, which will bring operational challenges to implement; however, we believe that the Firm will be materially compliant across our businesses with the rule. We have work to do to get there but we don't expect any material impact to our results. So let's take a closer look at the impact of the final SLR framework from this weekend on Page 5. So as you saw, the Basel committee released the framework this weekend which has gone a long way towards closing the gap relative to the US NPR. And the changes they made are responsive to industry feedback and seem sensitive to potential market impacts. Our initial analysis estimates that the impact will worsen both the Holding Company and bank ratios by only approximately 10 basis points relative to US proposed rules, so that would be 4.6% for each of the Holding Company and the bank. This impact is primarily driven by a positive related to improved assumptions on unfunded commitments, being slightly more than offset by the inclusion of written credit protection provisions previously not in the US rules. However, between the likely implementation in the future of NIM for derivative potential for future exposure, and the ability over time for us to improve netting for cash collateral, there should be significant improvement opportunity to our ratios in tens of basis points. So overall, our leverage action plans don't change materially. We'll be thoughtful and measured about implementation in 2014 and beyond, and our perspective on specific products and businesses is not just driven by capital implications but also by the importance to the broader franchise and client relationships. We do expect to reach 5% plus or minus at the Holding Company by the end of this year and to be compliant at the bank shortly thereafter. So the next step is for the US regulators to determine when and if they will adopt this new denominator, although we feel it's reasonably likely that they will. In addition over the weekend there was a consultation paper issued on NSFR. The proposal more closely aligns NSFR to the current evolved LCR framework in terms of definitions and assumptions, which we see as a positive step, and based upon the proposal, we estimate that the Firm is compliant today with NSFR. So turning to business performance, let's start with the Consumer and Community Banking on Page 6. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue with a return on equity of 20%. A couple of comments on drivers. We continue to make strong progress as I said on our customer satisfaction agenda, being recognized by the American Consumer Satisfaction Index, ACSI, for the second year running, as number one among largest banks, as well as number one in small business in three of four regions in the US, and number one among large banks for mortgage originations both by JD Power. On our Retail branch network, we've completed building out our key expansion markets, including California and Florida, and have reached leadership positions in each of our key markets. So we feel good about our footprints, at or around this level of 5,600 branches plus or minus, and our focus from here is on optimization including branch size and usage and leveraging digital capabilities. Lastly, our other key business drivers continue to grow strongly, reflecting increased consumer engagement evidenced by growth in deposits, investments, sales, and processing volumes. And our expenses, which are down nearly $700 million from last year, primarily due to lower mortgage banking expenses. And across CCB, we've reduced headcounts by 16,500 year over year. Turning to Page 7, Consumer and Community Banking generated net income of $780 million and an ROE of 28% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 4% and flat to the prior quarter. Net interest income is up 3% year-on-year, driven by the continued strong growth in deposits, partially offset by spread compression. And it's our investments in customer satisfaction, new builds, and CPC that's driving deposit growth, and also the highest account retention rates in a decade. On the non-interest revenue side we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue, with close to $190 billion of client investment assets, up 19% or $30 billion year over year, about half related to market performance and half due to net new money gains. Expenses are up 3% year-on-year, reflecting cost relating to the strengthening of the control environments, but have flattened sequentially as we improve efficiency in our same-store branches with starting down by over 6,000 year over year. Business banking loan balances are flat quarter-on-quarter and up 1% year-on-year, and production levels in the pipeline remain stable; however the environment has been challenging throughout the year due to competitive pressures, and we've maintained a high level of credit discipline. But we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see small businesses start to spend some of their cash reserves in 2014 but growth may be back-ended. Turning to Page 8, Mortgage Banking. Overall, Mortgage Banking net income was $562 million with an ROE of 11%. There are a couple of non-recurring items this quarter which I'll explain as we go through the results, but if you look at the top of the page you see production ex-repurchases with a reported pretax loss of $500 million, but if you look at the table on the top right, we've adjusted for the one-time items and you can see a loss of $91 million, slightly negative as expected and as we guided to. Revenues in the quarter were down 15% on lower application volumes, down 23%, and from a mix perspective, nearly 60% of loans were purchase loans this quarter, up from a little over 20% at the same time last year. Production expense includes approximately $400 million of non-MBS related legal expense. This is part of the significant item on the front page. Again, adjusting for this, we're seeing the benefits of actions we've taken to reduce expenses, with adjusted expenses coming down around $80 million quarter over quarter. Dealing with repurchases, as you know, during the quarter we reached a settlement with the GSEs on agency repurchase exposure. After allowing for the settlement amount we are releasing a net $130 million of repurchase reserves this quarter, with $90 million being added to compensatory fee reserves, as the settlement did not cover these potential fees. And before moving on to servicing, just looking out to the third quarter of 2014. The overall mortgage market is estimated to be roughly flat versus the fourth quarter, and although we do expect to see some continuation and expense improvements, revenues will continue to be challenged, and we're guiding for the first quarter similar to the last two quarters to be slightly negative in pretax deductions. Moving to servicing, pretax income about breakeven in the quarter. Servicing expenses of $663 million includes that $90 million of compensatory fee expense that I just mentioned, which related to loans previously contemplated in the repurchase reserves. Adjusting for this item our core expenses would have been slightly better than our previous guidance of $600 million for the quarter. Finally on Real Estate portfolio, pretax income of $1.2 billion including charge-offs of $167 million and a total reserve release of $950 million. The non-credit impaired reserve release for the quarter was $200 million, reflecting continued improvements in the portfolio but at a lower rate. But also we released $750 million of reserves in the purchase credit impaired portfolios, given recent significant improvements in HPI forecasts of approximately 5% for our portfolio through 2015. Turning to Page 9, Card, Merchant Services, and Auto. Net income of $1 billion, up 23% year-on-year with an ROE of 26%, or 22% excluding reserve releases, reflecting underlying excellent performance in the business. Consumer spending has been increasing and we're seeing strong growth in interchange revenue, reflecting growth in sales volume as well as seasonality in the Fourth Quarter. Year over year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was consistently strong at 11% and 14% respectively, with average outstanding flat year over year and quarter over quarter, yields remaining healthy but lower than a year ago. We do continue to see run-off of high rate and low FICO balances, with a move towards more engaged customers or transactors, which is a positive trend for spend and for credit performance but a negative for yield and we expect spread compression to continue into 2014. Net, this drove revenues of $4.7 billion, down 3% year over year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality with a revenue rate of 12.34% for the quarter. Consistent with these portfolio trends, the net charge-off rate has stayed at historical lows at 2.85%, and we released $300 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, given improved delinquencies and portfolio seasoning. Expenses are up 3% year-on-year but 16% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by increased marketing investment spend and costs associated with payments to customers required by consent order. A few words on Auto. Originations up 16% year-on-year, driving loan balances up 5% year-on-year and outpacing new car sales growth of 5%. And before we move on, as you know, there were two security -- data security breaches affecting our customers over the last several weeks. We took quick action to protect our customers and we continue to monitor both situations. The financial impact for the quarter is not significant. Moving on to Slide 10 and the Corporate Investment Bank. The CIB results this quarter include a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing the FVA, or funding valuation framework, as well as a $0.5 billion DVA loss. On this page we'll focus on the numbers excluding FVA and DVA in the table on the top right, and then I'll come look back to FVA on the next page. So we have net income of $2.1 billion on revenues of $8 billion and an ROE of 15%, and we maintained our number one ranking in both global IB fees and markets revenue, gaining share year over year of over 100 basis points in each. In banking, total revenue of $3 billion with IB fees slightly ahead of our guidance. IB fees of $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% quarter-on-quarter and down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower debt underwriting compared with a record prior-year quarter, partially offset by strength in equity underwriting. Treasury services revenues of $1 billion down 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by decision to reposition our trade loan portfolio. Moving on to Markets and Investor Services, our Markets revenue of $4.1 billion was flat year-on-year, also slightly ahead of the guidance we provided in the fourth quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.2 billion flat year-on-year with continued solid client flows, and Equity Markets of $873 million, down quarter-on-quarter off of a very strong equity derivative results last quarter as well as seasonality. Security Services revenue of $1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services revenue on record Assets Under Custody of $20.5 trillion and also on higher deposits. Just a comment on credit. We continue to see a favorable credit environment with stable credit quality trends, and our provisions continue to benefit from repayments and recoveries. Expenses of $4.9 billion, down 2% both year over year and quarter over quarter, driven by lower compensation. The comp to revenue ratio excluding FVA and DVA was 27% for the quarter, in line with the same quarter last year, and 30% for the full year, which is in line with our guidance albeit at the lower end on higher capital year over year. Loan balances are down 7% year-on-year, flat quarter-on-quarter, again primarily driven by trade loan balances which could trend down or continue to trend down as we optimize the portfolio. And at the bottom of the driver section, VaR remains low at $42 million for the quarter. So turning to Page 11 and coming back to the FVA adjustments. We are recording a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation, or an FVA framework for our OTC derivatives and structured notes this quarter, reflecting an industry migration towards incorporating the lifetime cost or benefit of unsecured funding into valuations. Just a couple of minutes on the background and dealing with -- why now? To date there has been no broad consensus that funding should be explicitly incorporated into valuation estimates; however, we believe that market practice for pricing and valuing derivatives has noticeably evolved during 2013 as we've been actively and continuously evaluating the market. We've now accumulated compelling evidence, both from transactions as well as industry pricing services, that dealers are pricing funding into uncollateralized derivatives with a degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA framework this quarter. In very simple terms, you can think of FVA which represents a funding spread over LIBOR as having the effect of present valuing market funding costs into the value of derivative receivables today. These funding costs otherwise would have affected net income over the life of the derivatives. Although the FVA framework applies to both assets and liabilities, the adjustment in the quarter is largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables for two reasons. First, the funding value of collateral is already incorporated in the valuation of collateralized derivatives. And second, credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding spreads, are already recorded on liabilities through DVA. So in thinking about the size of the adjustments, you have to consider the size, the tenor, the composition of the relevant portfolio, as well as the appropriate spread. So to give you some context, if you start with derivative receivables net of cash and securities collateral of approximately $50 billion, apply an average duration of approximately five years, and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that accounts for about $1 billion plus or minus the adjustment. Additionally, although there is a material overlap between DVA and FVA, the remaining difference contributes to the adjustments. So the loss in the quarter represents a transition adjustment to this new framework and can be thought of as a one-time event as we incorporate the concept into the portfolio value. Going forward, FVA will be incorporated into day-one valuation of derivatives, and implementing FVA should have the effect of significantly reducing our sensitivity to funding spreads going forward. We'll continue to refine FVA as the framework matures within the industry. So moving on to Page 12, the Commercial Bank saw a net income of nearly $700 million this quarter on revenue of $1.8 billion with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were up 6% per year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter. Net interest income increasing by 5% year over year, reflecting a one-time gain of approximately $100 million related to a lending related work out. Pricing spreads have continued to tighten across the board. Non-interest revenues were 8% up year-on-year, driven by record growth IB fees of over $500 million for the quarter. Our credit book continues to show very strong performance with net charge-off rates of only 7 basis points as we continue to focus on quality names and are comfortable passing on deals that don't meet our standards. Expenses were up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect higher product and headcount related expenses, primarily in controls. Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Our commercial Real Estate businesses continue to outperform the industry, up 15% year-on-year, 16 consecutive months of growth. But in C&I, overall loan growth remains flat, performing slightly below the industry as client demand continues to be low, competition high, and we remain focused on credit discipline over growth. While sentiment remains fragile there are pockets of activity and we are cautiously optimistic that borrowing demand may improve as confidence in the recovery spreads, but again that may be back-ended in the year as clients are very liquid. Finally, deposits are up 3% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality. Page 13 and Asset Management. Continued strong investment performance and long-term inflows drove a fourth consecutive year of record revenue. The quarter saw a net income of $568 million, up 18% year-on-year with an ROE of 25%. Record revenues of $3.2 billion, up 15% year-on-year are driven by three main factors. Strong fund performance as well as long term flows in every single asset class and from every region. Overall, benefiting from higher markets. And finally, a mark-to-market gain from a seed capital investment. This is the 19th consecutive quarter of long term inflows, with $16 billion for the quarter, bringing the full year to a total $90 billion, driving record Assets Under Management of $1.6 trillion, up 12%. We saw particular strength in multi-asset and equities and achieved number one ranking in 2013 for net flows in active long-term mutual funds. Expenses increased in line with performance of the business. And finally, in banking we continued to see growth across the board with record loan balances over $95 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Page 14, a total net income of nearly $800 million for corporate and private equity for the quarter. In private equity, a relatively quiet quarter with aggregate results more modest than in prior quarters. Treasury CIO showed a net loss of $78 million, driven by negative NII of nearly $100 million. But that compared to a run rate of negative NII of approximately $500 million in each of the first two quarters. This improvement reflects the benefit of higher investment security deals, up 50 basis points. The investment securities portfolio has also been a significant contributor to firm-wide NIM stability. And in the second half of the year we deployed $66 billion gross in new investments, principally mortgages and munis. Our ending balance of securities that classified as held to maturity grew to $24 billion and will continue to grow this quarter. And you should expect CIO Treasury NII to reach breakeven in the second half of 2014, all other things equal. And before I continue just let me talk for a second about NIM and NII, details of which are in the appendix. Firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were all up slightly quarter over quarter given market rates, and we expect both NIM and NII to be relatively stable in the near term, with the higher security deals I talked about being largely offset by loan spread compressions. Finally on this page, other corporate, sees a net income of $852 million and has a call out on the page. First, a net gain, all of these are after-tax, first a net gain of $800 million on the sale of Visa shares. We were and we remain a large Visa shareholder; however in the quarter, we saw the opportunity to risk manage approximately one-third of our Visa price risk exposure, but we clearly retain the ongoing litigation risks, both the ultimate amount and timing of settlements. Secondly, a net Real Estate gain of over $300 million on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and these two gains are being offset by nearly $800 million in legal expense, substantially all Madoff related. In addition, a few positive tax items in the quarter, largely the release of prior reserves. So Page 15 and our outlook to wrap up. We've actually covered all of the items on this page. So wrapping up just to say that our four leading franchises are all performing very strongly and we remain focused on serving our clients. We're committed to accomplishing our control agenda and adjusting successfully to the new global financial architecture, and we look forward to diving deeper into all of these things at Investor Day which is coming up in a few weeks' time. With that, thank you. And operator, you can open up the line to Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Guy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so just a quick thing just to clarify. The 10 basis points is actually lower, not higher, so it's a deduct, not an add for the new Basel proposal relative to the US rules. So remember as we've previously been disclosing our ratios, we used the US proposed rules that referenced a prior Basel denominator, so it's a 10 basis point worsening. And you're right that we had two major things contributing to that. We had a positive associated with better assumptions on draws on unfunded commitments, slightly more than offset by a negative on the risk [credit] protection. So we're still working through the prior details but our best estimate is that it's in the mid 20s in basis points, 25 basis points plus or minus.
MARIANNE LAKE: If you start with our gross growth CDS protection written, it's about $3.4 trillion, and by the time you net down from maturities it gets down to a couple hundred billion, but that is still impactful.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: Another thing to think about, it will be manageable because really this is kind of a static analysis before we start running the business slightly differently due to it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: We saw the proposals as having been thoughtful and we don't necessarily have to agree with the finer points of all of them, but it doesn't materially change our position or our thoughts going forward. And as Jamie said, all of our businesses will now socialize and optimize against what we understand to be the final rules when the US regulators adopt them.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, Guy, we're obviously going to do a bit more of a detailed deep dive on expenses over time on Investor Day. So for now what we have said is that you should expect our adjusted expenses for 2014 to remain at or below that level of $60 billion. We also said that in 2014, the continuation of our control agenda is adding an incremental $1 billion over 2013, so by remaining flat we're effectively self-funding that $1 billion. That's down.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not starving any expenses. We're just managing it in a disciplined way the way we've always done it and you look at the underlying numbers there's a lot of growth in the underlying numbers, but it's clearly true that some of the derisking and selling, spinoff OEP, and physical commodities will affect revenues a little bit, but obviously profits less.
MARIANNE LAKE: And, Guy, we've always been investing in the businesses and been willing to invest where the business takes and the returns justify that, but we are also finding efficiencies in the combination of the businesses, both consumer and the wholesale businesses, efficiency in the same store, branches we talked about, CIB continues on its journey on the back office and front office integration, and obviously mortgage expenses will continue to trend down both in line with improved credit trends and also as we proactively manage the portfolio. So there's a lot of moving parts but it's not at the expense of our willingness to invest in the businesses for returns.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's not just about expenses. You have to think about the whole equation. If you look at a mortgage market we'll see some improvement in the first quarter 2014, and we'll also continue to work on expense efficiency in the business. But if you look at a market which is currently being estimated about $1.3 trillion, down from $1.9 trillion, and honestly a couple weeks ago it was $1.1 trillion, so it's a very small market, one we haven't seen the likes of since year 2000, in a market like that it's very challenging to deliver through the cycle returns. So we went through over the last few years, years with very strong revenues and margins, and we are in a challenging environment as we look into 2014 but we're working on it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, so the way to think about it in the short-term relative to say the submission that we just did or in the near future is that obviously, a realized loss experience that is higher than we have previously seen informs your view and judgment as to what you could reasonably expect to happen in a future stress period. So it is fair to say that that would drive our expectations (inaudible) on operational losses to be slightly higher. Having said that, it's not as if our previous submissions didn't contemplate there to be significant stresses in operating losses, so I would characterize it as incremental and certainly not from a low base.
MARIANNE LAKE: And also, Guy, sorry, just remember that every quarter we move forward we generate capital, improve our ratios, so there's lots of moving parts to the ultimate outcome.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Betsy.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the way you should look at it is something like $40 billion gets reinvested in a year. The basic assumption you should make is it's an average duration of three or four years, so think of a five-year bonds or something like that, and just use the implied yield curve. Obviously (inaudible) munis or MBS or something like that, but I need to point out that it's completely dependent upon the decisions we make, so we can change that kind of at will if we want to extend or reduce the duration of equity of the Company.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's both.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a little bit of both. It's mostly just the change in the yield curve.
MARIANNE LAKE: We have slower mortgage fee payments, we're able to reinvest at higher yields, we're reinvesting in high quality assets, munis with high spreads, so it's both.
JAMIE DIMON: Well you have got to separate the loans. On the commercial side we'll obviously be competitive and we're not assuming anything heroic in terms of rate spreads getting worse or better but they're low. You could argue down the road they might actually go up a little bit as capital requirements and liquidity requirements go way up, so but we'll be competitive. We're assuming you have to be competitive in loan spreads.
JAMIE DIMON: Think of the card business, we try to run it fully match funded so the spreads are about the same, and somewhere like 65% is at an interest rate something like 40% is transactor almost locked in rates, so which we also match fund.
JAMIE DIMON: So we have replaced 2 million debit cards or will have I think by the end of this week.
MARIANNE LAKE: Credit and debit.
JAMIE DIMON: Credit and debit. To protect our employees, to protect our customers, et cetera. So I think that look, unfortunately, this cyber security stuff we've now pointed out for a year is a big deal, it's not going to go away, and all of us have a common interest in being protected so this might be a chance for retailers and banks to for once work together as opposed to sue each other like we've been doing the last decade, and but it's in all of our interest to do it. And I think all people involved in this know that the third parties with its machines, regional machines, your mainframes, you really have to put an extreme effort into protect yourself so this story is not over, unfortunately.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, honestly I think you'll see both. I think you'll see chip and pin in all cards and then a lot of online type of transactions in tokenization. They both have very, very good technologies to protect consumers and companies from fraud.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, that's correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct.
JAMIE DIMON: There's an unrealized gain approximately of like $3 billion today. It's on our books of zero. This goes back to when Visa was spun off many, many years ago.
MARIANNE LAKE: But that's right, Betsy, net of hedging.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Glenn.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess look, there are some structural headwinds and you've seen a lot of adjustment in the marketplace, people reduce the size of their inventory, and what you don't know going forward is what's going to happen to spreads. But I look at it a little bit like there's a secular and a cyclical. There will be headwinds from regulations et cetera. But over time, assets that people need to manage and buy and sell is going to go up over time, not go down. So what happens in 2014 is hard to say, our business is plenty diversified between rates, credit, emerging markets, FX, commodities, et cetera.
MARIANNE LAKE: Certainly helping out stability.
JAMIE DIMON: Which is definitely helping out stability.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say Glenn it's ongoing and it will be beneficial. I think material might be a stretch at this point, but and it is a lot of work as you say, so there's a whole industry working on that and us too we expect to be beneficial but not a game changer.
JAMIE DIMON: So the SLR at 5% we do not think is going to be an issue for us. We barely begun to manage it, there are a lot of things you can do in how you change your business. The bank issue is a little bit different but think of that as more structural. What you did in the bank over the last 20 years and what we're not going to do in the bank going forward, that will take a little bit longer, but not because -- the reasons is it takes longer to change our business models to accommodate it.
MARIANNE LAKE: I also think if you look at the other things I mentioned in terms of opportunity for putting NIM to one side, our estimate of the new Basel rules that we had we've given you a 10 basis point movement backwards has a conservative estimate of what we could ultimately achieve over time in terms of the ability to net cash collateral for derivatives just given certain of the conditions. But again over time that will also be manageable like compression trades and like many of those other things. So we haven't changed our view, we can manage against these targets by doing it thoughtfully and methodically and not having to race through it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well we've said already that we would be willing to run between 10% to 10.5% so we're on a journey here. We think we can get 10% plus or minus at the end of the year. It could be plus and it could be minus but we think at this point based on what we know that running at that level of buffer of margins should be enough. Obviously we'll be more informed as we go through CCAR processes, but that's our point of view at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so we have been adding, I mean I talked about the second half of the year gross adding $66 billion. We've never talked about second quarter, we added quite a lot in the second quarter, and yes we have plans to continue to do that in 2014, and yes, we expect our NII dollars to be relatively stable, possibly slightly up over the course of the top of the year, but relatively stable.
JAMIE DIMON: But not in a lot of investments. Look at the balance sheet today. We have almost $350 billion at central banks, most of it's Fed. Another $350 billion of very high quality investment securities, and those two things combined equal our loans of $700 billion. So the Company's very, very liquid. We don't really need to invest more, but it depends on how much we grow deposits.
JAMIE DIMON: Well I already said what we're going to do is what you should assume now is implied yield curves and constant reinvestment, but if you had rates move up 100 basis points all at once, we would probably be much more aggressive doing something like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously, you're going to understand that the necessary caveat that we can't predict for you, the patent and the amount of legal expenses in any one quarter over several quarters; however it would be fair to say that we would certainly hope that for the full year, the full-year cost isn't the first quarter annualized, but we can't be certain of that. And with respect to reasonably possible loss range, it did come down from $5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter to $5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter given the legal expense.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I mean, if you think about -- and you can do -- we've done about as much as you can do based on analyst estimates, but if you think about we want to get to 10% plus or minus by the end of next year all else other things being equal, that is a priority, but it is not the only priority. And so as we think about our capital plan, we've consistently said obviously it's a Board decision ultimately and they'll contemplate them in the natural course. But we would like to have the flexibility to be able to potentially increase dividends and also have flexibility to get to do reasonable repurchases, it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to think about how we thought about this year as being relatively consistent with last.
JAMIE DIMON: So every year, we try to have a disciplined approach about what we stay in and what we don't, and I think we probably were more disciplined this year about the things we don't need, both from derisking, capital, management focus, controls, et cetera. If you look at the prepaid card business we are not dealing directly with customers, it's kind of secondary, it's a complex business and we were just better off letting someone else do it. It won't affect the four main franchises that Marianne spoke about that are doing so well. It's just kind of a product we used to do so we're not going to do it anymore. There's a lot of risk associated with it.
JAMIE DIMON: So we didn't use the word cautiously optimistic. We're using the word optimistic because we are actually optimistic, and if you have a US economy starting to grow you will see loan growth and volume growth and of course all these businesses, we are actually optimistic about the US economy in particular. We spend a lot of time analyzing what rising rates, growth, change of QE3 taper will do to deposits, so it might actually have a diminishing effect on the growth of deposits, but we're happy with it, we're still growing share. I'm not sure you're going to see deposits go negative before you seen loan growth. I think you're trying to fine tune it too closely there.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so remember that in our card business we have both dynamics of core growth as well as still some continued run-off. We did reach the inflection point during the second half of 2013 where that run-off was no longer exceeding growth, and so we're set to grow but very modestly in 2014.
JAMIE DIMON: But more importantly, 93% of the business awards, we've had 10% growth in spend, we've had was it 14% growth in merchant processing, so we are very happy with the card business. It performed exceptionally well, excellent credit trends so outstanding growth is less important but obviously we like to see some of that too.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: Just a little bit relating to Target but not in general.
JAMIE DIMON: A lot of the card growth is coming from T&E and travel and restaurants and things like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so just to remind you what we said back in February or last year, in the consumer businesses we talked about over the two years, so 2013 and 2014, mortgage seeing headcount reductions of 13,000 to 15,000, and the consumer business predominantly in the branches of 4,000. By the end of 2013, we had seen a 16,500 in total, so in the consumer bank we are actually not only accelerated but outperforming our expectations in terms of our ability to run those branches efficiently and still maintain very strong customer satisfaction and retention rates. And then in the mortgage base, we have seen total headcount down 11% year over year against that 13,000 to 15,000 two-year target. So obviously we continue to work on the strategy and the size and our approach to mortgage market, but they're obviously relative to those numbers, there's still a little way to go.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would think about -- talking about the number of branches I would think about the fact that it all goes to retail distribution, houses will continue to do consolidations and relocations as it makes sense for us to do that in our footprint, and we'll continue to respond to customer preferences, which will mean that over the course of the next decade we'll be looking at obviously the size and use of branches as branches come up for renovation and release and things like that. But we're not expecting a material change in the number as a macro matter, so 5,600 plus or minus, and it is going to be based on customer preferences. As it relates to headcount reductions, we're already aggressively looking at the efficiency in our same-store branches and have been very successful, so we are looking at starting models, physical capabilities, automation, we're on that journey and we continue to be on it, but I don't see that it's going to be a step change relative to our previous expectations. We've already exceeded them, might be some more, but it's not a step change.
MARIANNE LAKE: So let's start with commercial and say that it's plus or minus zero at this point, so I think it's going to be strong for long, but that's not really going to be a reserve story for a little while. In the card business, we had been talking about having potentially reached bottom for a period of time. We haven't yet or it doesn't seem we have, so as you look into 2014, if things do continue to strengthen, it's possible there will be some more releases but not at the levels that you saw in 2013. So in the first couple of quarters, and usually the first quarters are instructive on that point, usually that's when you see a material improvement if there's going to be one in terms of flow rates. And then on the mortgage space, two things. We have $2.6 billion of NCI reserve left. We've talked before about the fact that we think our more steady run rate number will be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, so there's another $1 billion to $1.5 billion to come in that space over the course of the next year or so potentially, obviously environment allowing. And then on an NCI --- I'm sorry --- on the purchased credit impaired portfolio, we have $4.2 billion left off the two releases we just took. But remember that it's a life-of-loan portfolio. So something would have to change now, and the environment improve, for us to expect to take more releases. It is possible, but nothing --- we don't expect to be taking releases up to that $4.2 billion.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we did have some tax benefits this quarter. We had about $300 million after-tax.
MARIANNE LAKE: Related to a number of items but state and local tax, some reserve releases, not one particular thing.
MARIANNE LAKE: It was just a little over 30%, low 30%s.
MARIANNE LAKE: No change.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so we said I think at Investor Day plus 100, plus or minus in a year, when Gordon spoke earlier in 2013, we've revisited based upon our assessment of cost and preferences and activity and think we've
MARIANNE LAKE: So if you look at bab and then obviously also at Investor Day we'll go through it more.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's a bit of both. Just one thing on mortgage. Just a tiny clarification. We expect Mortgage deductions to be broadly the same as we've seen in the second half but we would expect to continue to see improvements in the expense base in the servicing business. But having said all of that it's a combination of relatively stable but potentially slightly higher NII. Yes, strength in fees on the basis of the strong driver growth that we talked about, and then our $60 billion or less of expenses. So we're working through all of the efficiency opportunities across the businesses, including in the retail space to be able to deliver positive operating leverage.
JAMIE DIMON: And Mike I think the way you get to it is each of our businesses is always trying to drive efficiency while investing. That doesn't change any particular year. It's kind of a non-stop kind of thing and you see those efficiencies because every business has pretty good margins after investing. And sometimes the revenue growth itself is either episodic or the timing isn't exactly the same how you invest, but if you see the drivers, which is deposits, investable assets, asset management, number of corporate clients, market shares, they are all pretty
JAMIE DIMON: Well VaR itself is a calculation that's based upon a whole bunch of different things. We don't deliberately lower VaR.
MARIANNE LAKE: With VaR, Mike it really is just a feature of two things. If you look at our look back at VaR, across asset classes we're at very low levels of volatility, just across all of the asset classes, and that's actually driving it. If volatility picks up, that could pick up, we're not driving that down, and it's also derisking an SEP, that
JAMIE DIMON: Volcker, all things equal we would say not much. I think when we referred to the $1 billion or $2 billion, we were talking about regulations in general, including derivatives, SAS, clearing houses, and Volcker, and that number we still kind of have in the back of our mind but it's hard to tell what the effect of all those things are. The $1 billion or $2 billion I would say was probably in the conservative category.
JAMIE DIMON: That's the one that's hard to tell. I would guess-MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so it's very difficult to back test because these things are all interrelated so it's not entirely possible to disentangle everything, but obviously we've gone through the changes in 2013, some of that will be reflected, but this is a number that we would expect to be reflected to the degree that it is all over the course of the next two years.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember some of those things reduce capital requirements, some people are making dramatic changes in their business models which may free up market share for those of us that have additional market share, so it all remains to be seen. And that was also a static analysis. Some certain things we may reprice a little bit because of the capital liquidity requirements around them, so it all remains to be seen.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, Mike.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would just reiterate what we previously said, which is if you look at Servicing and in particular, the quarterly run rate, which call it $600 million in line with our expectation that's going to continue to trend down towards $500 million by the end of the year in 2014. And then on the production side while we obviously are going to see our expenses to a degree of variable with the size of the market, we're continuing to also work on opportunities to make the fixed cost base more efficient, so hopefully we'll deliver some of that in 2014 too. And we'll do a more precise job of putting a bow around that for you at Investor Day.
MARIANNE LAKE: So that's an excellent question. I would say assuming we have no significant losses going forward then we feel like we should be close to our high point, albeit maybe a little bit more in the first half of 2014. The reality, just two comments on operational risk. The first is unlike market and credit risk, although all of the parameters and the confidence levels are effectively the same, it doesn't naturally recalibrate itself to changes in the business environment, or to your business mix or model, if you structurally reduce risk. It's very backward-looking, and in that sense it differs because it doesn't recalibrate. And so, as a result if you just let the models continue to predict based on historical losses going forward, you would need to be carrying that elevated level of operational risk capital forward for a reasonably long time. It's a 1 in a 1,000 year horizon, so think about it in terms of 5 or 10 years, not 1 or 2 years. And so for that reason, we are very interested and working very hard with the industry to try and figure out how to better model changes in the business environment, and to both model and defend structural and permanent risk changes in our businesses in order to be able to recoup some of that more quickly. But at this point I would characterize that as work that has not yet been done, that is in progress, and so for the foreseeable futurity will be elevated.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Matt.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So to put Volcker aside for a second, with respect we didn't update obviously the list, we are going to do that at Investor Day. We talked about that for you. It's more important to think less about revenue, but more on the impact on the bottom line, given some of these businesses they now have been returning hurdle, may have been in the investment phase, and actually not been breaking even. So I think it's fair to say that if you consider the impact on the bottom line more so than revenues that it's going to be modest, and we will do work to update you on that. But remember, it also is going to do two things, release capital which will be a positive, and also improve the quality of the businesses and the control environment and the complexity which would all be positive too.
JAMIE DIMON: It is the ones that you all mentioned, and we put them in our 10-K.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it is the ones you mentioned, and as you look at our disclosures in the 10-Q. Every quarter, the items that we think raise themselves to the level of public disclosure are in that document. So look to last quarter and next quarter and you will see, but we shouldn't comment specifically.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think so.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not this point, but obviously the Ks are a few weeks away.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I mean, I think -- if you think about the sort of basis for capital and put aside whether you like the way it works in a modeled environment, your reserves, that is for expected losses and capital to your expected losses. So in theory you shouldn't get explicit credit for them. I think the bigger point for us is, if you look at the sorts of things driving our capital levels to be as elevated as they are, they are things for example, like the PLMBS issues, and also certain of the very large mortgage DOJ and national mortgage settlement and ISR compensation issues. It's our belief that this Firm is not exposed today or will not be exposed going forward to those levels of risk, at anywhere near that scale going forward. But as I have said, we have no ability at this point to scale those back, and that's what we are very focused on. So it's less really about whether we are getting credit for our reserves, and a little bit more about how we try in the industry to evolve the framework in partnership with the regulators, and defend over time that there are structural risk reductions that mean those risks are no longer present in that scale.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not specifically. We did fairly well in cash, but our cash platform is not as mature as some others. So I think we would characterize the performance as good, but coming off of as I said a very strong quarter for equity derivatives in the third quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just I'll comment. On Page 15 last quarter, we showed you a bunch of things we're working on. We didn't replace the page, because it has not meaningfully changed. That is not to say that at the margins we don't continue to look at our businesses in terms of sophistication and derisking. So I would say that while there may be things that the margin that we will explore over time, then there is nothing structurally big that you should be aware of.
MARIANNE LAKE: And again, we will do some more of that for you at Investor Day.
JAMIE DIMON: That's a hard question but -- so Middle Market if you go back -- so I am going to do just Middle Market because that's the one that's kind of at a 30% too. Years ago, you used to average more like 45%. It looks like to us, that what you have -- is they have a lot more deposits and a lot less utilization. And so obviously, they are going to use some of their own money before they borrow against a revolver or something like that, and one day, you would expect it to go up. We aren't guessing what's going to happen in 2014, but I would say, we will be sitting here one day when you have had a very strong economy it will be 10 points higher.
JAMIE DIMON: Well multi-families a big portion of that and you see that in a lot of -- I would say obviously the major cities is pretty much where you would say -- it's hard to answer specifically. I think both multi-family and other real estate loans, it's really the big cities.
JAMIE DIMON: Sure. Change either that, or how you reimburse clients for deposits, and obviously it will go into how you price them on your business. We are not expecting that to happen, but obviously we would do that, and you have other alternatives, so you might invest some of that money elsewhere.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, and it's also important to point out there is a large portion of that $350 billion are deposits or cash that we would consider to be client non-operational deposit. And as a result, we don't give ourselves any liquidity value for those, so that is why we are putting them overnight in the Fed.
JAMIE DIMON: Mostly marketing.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's predominantly marketing, and with respect to marketing it can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So it's not an unexpected number for us, it's just higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third.
JAMIE DIMON: But we have been doing a good job of card acquisition of high quality cards. You see -- I forgot the number, but it's up quite a bit. So we have some good active programs out there.
JAMIE DIMON: Way optimistic.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I think that would be optimistic. Obviously, we will determine the third quarter as we go through it. We will cover employee issuance, but that's certainly our expectation and maybe more, but I don't think you should expect us to catch up from PB.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, we want to meet our own objective of the 9.5% or 10%. And obviously the litigation costs hurt our ability to do that, so we caught up on that. And also the stock price is a lot higher than it was when we talked about trying to aggressively buyback some stock. So we always look at that as a important thing. We don't just buyback stock regardless of price. Not that we can't get that price, but when it was at $33 a share or whatever, that was a extraordinary compelling price.
JAMIE DIMON: The Board will decide when the time comes and they look at all of the priorities et cetera.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would just reiterate what I said before, which is getting to our target ratio is a priority, it is not the only one. We will have to see how things play out in 2014. But if you do the math then you can take your own estimates of what you think we will earn next year. We should be able to also have the opportunity to take it to buy more than just employee issuance, so you are just going have to -- we want that flexibility. That is what we submitted for, and we will obviously manage through each quarter as we see it.
JAMIE DIMON: It may depend on what we sell, how much we can mitigate, what the final rules are and stuff, so there is a lot of moving parts.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's just a little less than $100 million.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. So there is no change -- (Multiple Speakers). There is no real change in how we do anything.
JAMIE DIMON: Are you talking about total loans -- ?
MARIANNE LAKE: Are you talking about total and core, or are you talking about reported and -- ?
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I am going to try to answer the question, and tell me if I don't I'm sorry. But if you look at our actual total loans for the whole Firm year-over-year, our gross reported was 0.6%, so just call it just shy of 1%. But underlying that core loan growth was about 4%. So I think that as we look forward, we expect core growth to continue at or stronger than those levels, and we have reached as you say in card the point where seasonality aside, that inflection point where we should expect net modest growth. So and as I said, we are going to have to all wait and see how client demand plays out in the small business and Middle Market space. But we are hoping that at the second half of 2014, when the confidence in the economic recovery -- we have confidence but when others join us, that they will actually start to borrow and spend.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, that's our hope.
MARIANNE LAKE: Because we also are seeing -- we talked earlier about the fact we have been seeing and we expect to continue to see some spread compression in loans, that at this point in the near-term -- we didn't talk about the whole year for 2014 but in the near-term, we are expecting the improvement that we would see as a result of higher yields on investment securities et cetera to be offset by or largely offset by the compression in loan growth.
JAMIE DIMON: The way to look at that is that, is what drives the Company is serving clients. And so, we don't target just to get rid of commitments or something like that. But obviously, we have asked all of the people in businesses who to start to optimize a little bit commitments, balance sheet, LCR, SLR, Basel III. And so, you probably see a little bit of a squeeze in commitments as they do that, but not at the expense of trying to do a good job for clients.
JAMIE DIMON: The other thing I should point out is some of those commitments are much more capital or liquidity hogs than others.
JAMIE DIMON: So that is where you can see a little bit more of the squeeze.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think if you look back and see that -- I mean, let's talk about this year and last year. If you look at 2013 reported, you would have seen that our commodities revenues counted for in the low teens of our markets revenues, but that's on an accounting basis. When you think about, so that's just a revenue pure only. If you think about the economic revenue because obviously it's an accounting growth where it is much smaller number than that. So call it mid single digit, mid to 6%, 7%. But then it was a business that was in a combination of being built out so it wasn't fully mature. And also we are selling parts of the business that are highly capital intensive to us. So think about the impact of the bottom line as being considerably more modest and with some capital benefit.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would -- a couple things. First of all, if you just take the second half versus first half, we said that we thought the overall market was down 30% to 40%. It was down about 33%. So it was in line with our expectations and our performance is in line with that too. So you have got to remember that the revenue versus closed loan volume, and how that gets recognized there is some timing differences. With respect to market share, if you look backwards into 2013, the overall size of the market was revised up, which means that our market share was -- all else things being equal --just relatively revised down, doesn't change anything. But going forward, our market share will be a factor of obviously the size of the market, but also our pricing discipline to make sure we want to get an appropriate risk adjusted return. So we would gain share but only if we can do it, getting paid for the risk and the cost of servicing.
JAMIE DIMON: And the whole reduction was refi.
MARIANNE LAKE: And the whole reductions was refi -- yes, I should say that, yes. (Multiple Speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: So I would say that people in the business has slowly been extending the credit box, if you look at LTV -- I am talking about over the last 18 months, if you look at LTVs, if you go to different cities, I am not sure you are going to see a dramatic expansion of the credit box, because all of the rep and warranty and litigation and stuff like that, where anything that is not qualified mortgages.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, and for qualified mortgages, credit is available, GSE is 90% LTV, on the Ginnie Mae side closer to 100% LTV, so there is credit availability. You just have to have the ability to pay.
JAMIE DIMON: And FHA will set its own policy. But even there I think you'll have a much tighter underwriting than the FHA guidelines, because of how much FHA's cost people.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we know for the most part the contours of the regulation at this point, and some of the fine tuning still needs to be done. So you can see a lot of banks globally, adjusting to the new financial architecture, and the effect of that will be different, different parts of the world, slightly different for certain products, but it will
JAMIE DIMON: Nice to have the rules and live with them, and now we have to push them down and understand them in a little more detail.
MARIANNE LAKE: There is still a few things we are waiting for, I mean, long-term debt requirements, something to look out for in the first quarter, but I mean, having more clarity is definitely helpful.
JAMIE DIMON: You have seen some people make bigger strategic changes, some are making small tactical changes, and then we are going to report a lot more on what we think the effect of all of this in Investor Day.
JAMIE DIMON: Again, I look a little bit different. I look like -- the pot will change and adjust to new world, but from there will probably grow. Because if you look at underlying numbers, the amount of investable assets around the world is going to double over 10 years, the amount of needs of corporations, i.e -- and sovereigns and super nationals, and ECM, DCM advice will double over 10 years, so there is a -- there will be a strong underlying business. Spreads, products, those things have always changed. Spreads have been coming down my whole life, and yet we have a healthy business -- and so we expect that fixed income after some adjustment will be a good business. We think a lot of these trends are cyclical, not secular and that's how we are positioned for it.
MARIANNE LAKE: And we have paychecks.
JAMIE DIMON: And we have -- (Multiple Speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: And it is possible that -- if people leave and the things we price it will go back to -- all businesses have to have a normal return on capital for the average player otherwise they wouldn't exist. So we do think you will see some of that. There will be pieces that go to non-banks which is fine.
MARIANNE LAKE: Look, I think the reality is I don't know anymore than you do. I just that think given the changes that were made, it seemed to be positive and constructive as reason to believe that the US regulators would want to leverage that. I could be wrong, and I am not aware of -- obviously, we did comment letters on the US MPR, but I am not aware of any specifics on the portion.
JAMIE DIMON: So I would just add, if you listen to what regulators said, not this time, but going back they intended to make Basel and US rules common about the rules. They did not say they intended to have the same percent. So we are just assuming the 5% is going to stay.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct.
JAMIE DIMON: And we think there will be a couple other adjustments going forward too.
MARIANNE LAKE: So if you look at the total Firm consolidated, then they actually come out quite nicely. If you think about our target for [Tier 1] common at 10% to 10.5% and a leverage target of 5% to 5.5%. So I think the leverage ratio feels like as a consolidated matter, it is a simple backstop exactly as it is supposed to be and not a binding constraint. The devil is in the detail as you push that down, as I have said for the individual business and products. And then, obviously consider it in the context of the whole client relationship. I think as we look forward, CCAR is something to just be thoughtful about. Because it's a stressed scenario. It is evolving in terms of the maturity, as well as a move over time towards being on a Basel III advanced approach. So if I had to guess I would say CCAR could be.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say -- so I would say that our Tier 1 capital needs to be at 11%-plus. We said we are going to run it at 10% to 10.5% above [Tier 1] common. I would suggest the gap will be prepped and maybe more. Maybe more prepped than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, everyone.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you. Talk to you in another quarter.",0.08999999999999986,0.1099999999999988,1,0.08633432613005783,0.09166981400340068
8,Q4_2015,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32, and a return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the results is legal expense of $400 million after-tax for a range of matters, and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter. In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after-tax, which related to moneys owed to Washington Mutual, in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We've shown this on the page as legal related, and the benefits recorded in revenue in Corporate. Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall Company's performance benefited from diversification across our businesses. We saw strong growth in Consumer drivers, on the back of improvement in the US economy, in large part generating core loan growth of 16% for the Company. Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts, leading to lower client activity and lower inventory. Against this backdrop, the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline, and exceeded targets. Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over page 2, on page 3, the firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion, and record EPS of $6 a share. And a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion. Revenue was down 1%, or $1.3 billion, driven by non-core items, most notably by business simplification in the Investment Bank, and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly. We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion, and a 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the strengthening dollar this year, we also self funded incremental investments. Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion. With obviously the biggest area of stress in Wholesale being Oil & Gas, against which we built about $550 million in reserves this year, including $124 million this quarter. And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve built in 2016, but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant. We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining, including $35 million this quarter. We're watching this sector closely, and similarly, if commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve build, but would not expect them to be significant. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 billion, including dividends of $1.72 a share. Turning to page 4. Starting on the top left, overall, our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year on year, and our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion, with of course the biggest driver being the reduction of approximately $200 billion of Wholesale nonoperating deposits, ultimately reflected in lower cash balances. In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories, except for loans, which reflects the 16% core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other Wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term Wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile markets and general deleveraging, driving risk off and lower inventory across products. As client demand for leverage grows, we will likely out put some of that balance sheet back to work. Moving to the right. The story on deposits continues to be a very positive one, as we delivered some incremental reductions in nonoperating balances, while consistently growing retail and operating deposits. On the bottom left, overall NII was up about $300 million, driving a 7 basis point improvement in NIM. The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans, but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant. Looking forward to the first quarter, expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains, as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone, so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII. Perhaps the highlight of this page, on the bottom right, is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% Method 2 G-SIB bucket, and that we are in or close to the 2% Method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day. Turning to page 5. We're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets, with the firm's advanced fully phased in CET1 ratio at 11.6%, and our standardized fully phased in ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction in risk weighted assets. With net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives, as well as secured financing balances and these deliver a more meaningful reduction under the standardized approach. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future. Firm and Bank SLR were at 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1 billion of net repurchases, and common dividends of $0.44 a share. Let's turn to page 6, and Consumer and Community banking. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income, on revenue of $11.2 billion, and an ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full-year expense was down by nearly $1 billion, or half of our commitment, if you adjust for legal, and $150 million of incremental investments this year. Going forward, we will look for opportunities to further reinvest. You can see headcount was down by 12,000 for the year, and nearly 43,000 since 2012. The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year over year, average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 25% driven by mortgage, but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000 households, and our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20%, to roughly 23 million customers, the largest of the major US banks. Moving to page 7, Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated strong results for the quarter, with net income of $968 million, and an ROE of 32%, on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter on quarter, it was down 5% year on year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, non-interest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year on year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NIR to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter. Expense was down 3% year on year on lower headcount from branch efficiency. And additionally, client assets were up 2%, and Business Banking average loan balances up 6%. Next, Mortgage Banking on page 8. Overall net income was $266 million, originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally, and we continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter, and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially, on strong loan growth, as well as on higher MSR risk management. For the full year, our non-interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion, broadly in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue, as servicing balances continue to decline, and as we expect production margins will compress in the smaller market. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million. Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter, related to exiting the OCC's consent order, but it was down 10% year on year, as we continue to manage costs. Finally, on credit, net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflects the quality of our portfolio. Moving on to page 9, Card, Commerce Solutions and Auto. Overall net income of $1.2 billion, and an ROE of 24%. Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year on year, driven principally by two nonrecurring items. The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to non-core portfolio exits, and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million, on the IPO of Square. Adjusted the revenue rate was 11.9%. And in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong, and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on non-interest revenues, while driving growth in NII. Year over year, we saw growth of 12% in auto, loan and lease balances, 6% in card sales volumes, 3% in cards core loans, as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions, respectively. Expense of $2.2 billion, flat quarter on quarter, but up 4% year on year, reflected higher depreciation on auto lease growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat into the first quarter, as we continue to invest. While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales, with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December. And we gained nearly 40 basis points of share year over year, with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth. Finally, on credit, in auto, net charge-offs were 50 basis points, and while higher, they were still below our long-term expectations. And in cards, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year. And given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy, we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016. Now turning to page 10, and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion, on revenue of $7.1 billion, and an ROE of 10%. In Investment Banking for the full year, we continued to rank number one in global IB fees, and number one in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our number two ranking, and grew wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we ranked number one globally, up from number three last year. And in DCM, we ranked number one across high yield, high grade and loans. Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11%, driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% for the quarter, in a market that was down 12, largely driven by North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in a market down 12, with the US remaining somewhat slow, but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia. And debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a record last year, where we saw an unprecedented number of large fee events. Treasury services revenue was flat quarter on quarter, but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spreads. In markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall, across products. Investor risk appetite was significantly dampened by a series of market events, and clients retrenched and de-risked early. With that backdrop, the markets businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue, in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends, with adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year on year. In Fixed Income, rates markets were up, given US and ECB monetary policy actions, offset by year-on-year declines in currencies in emerging markets, as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty [things] persisted as well as the Commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those same things, plus a number of single-name corporate events. Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker dealer services last year, with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia, compared to a strong prior year. With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity, we were light risk going into the year end, and inventory was low and so far, our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know, it is early, and it's difficult to predict how the quarter will play out. Security services revenue was $933 million, in line with guidance, given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset-based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, which includes seasonality. On credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million, which included $63 million related to Oil & Gas. Finally, expense of $4.4 billion was down 20% year on year, mainly driven by lower legal, the comp to revenue ratio was 26% for the quarter, and 30% for the full year. Moving on to page 11 and the Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million, on revenue of $1.8 billion, and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially, but relatively flat year on year, with NII up 3% on higher loan balances, despite spread compression, offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year. However, for the full year, it was a record for Investment Banking, with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from 2014. Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairment on leased Corporate aircraft. On the reassessment of residual values, the remaining balance sheet value of this portfolio is modest. We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year on year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry, as we continue to invest in this business and gain share. In C&I, loans were up 11%, largely driven by Corporate client banking on the back of several large transactions. Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong, with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs. However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to Oil & Gas and $26 million for Metals & Mining. Moving on to page 12, Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $500 million, with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE, on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year on year, driven by lower performance fees in alternatives. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year on year, roughly equally explained by lower performance fee-driven compensation, as well as a benefit from refining the value of the health of that asset. Assets under management of $1.7 trillion, and client assets of $2.4 trillion, were down 1% and 2% year over year, respectively. We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter, resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion, with solid inflows in equities being more than offset by weakness in Fixed Income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had strong long-term investment performance, with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years, which should be supportive of future flows And for the full year, we had positive long-term inflows of $16 billion. In lending, we had record balances of $110 billion, up 7% year on year, driven by both mortgage, as well as traditional loans. Turning to page 13 and Corporate. Treasury and CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in this result, there is a pretax benefit of $178 million, relating to certain securities held at a discount, that were called at par. And this was in our NII. Other Corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after-tax, for the legal related matters we discussed earlier, as well as a contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million pretax. Turning to page 14. I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation, and this page is for your reference. Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the year. So in summary, a solid quarter, and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital, translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%. We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points. Delivered strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base, including growing retail deposits at 10%, and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our G-SIB surcharge, and capital levels. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, again, I would say that the pipeline coming into 2016 in M&A was good, solid, up, in fact. Obviously, volatility can dampen the confidence of Boards and CEOs. Dialogues are pretty active, and we think the types of deals that we'll see in 2016 will look different. But I think, in the first couple of weeks, it's not been particularly strong, and we do need to see some of the stability come back, I think, for us to really see that conversion start to pick up.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, less mega-deals, more mid-sized deals, more cross border. It's a little different. Actually, more deal count, less big mega-deals, could be very constructive for revenue, but we're likely to see it be a little bit different in 2016. But honestly, the pipeline is good, and -- yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: North America will be a tough comp. It was very strong in 2015, but Europe could be very constructive.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So, the way we do our reserves, just for context, because I think it's important is, obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive. And it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss, given [default for] certain of our customers. But I think it's also the case, just for context, to know that it is very name-by-name specific. Specific conditions at clients matter greatly. And so when we do these estimates, they are directionally correct, and order of magnitude correct. But that's just for context. Oil -- we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel, and here we are, and stayed there for, call it, 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million. And that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed. So, it is not the current market expectation that oil will flatline. It is the expectation, right now, that there will be a modest recovery. Based upon that, we would expect to take some additional reserves, but for them to be more modest, less significant. But that's the range; if oil's at $30 and stays here for a long time, up to $750 million.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: I think, first, I'd say we try to be very conservative, always, and so we're not trying to put up as little as possible. You know me, I'd put up more if I could. But accounting rules dictate what you can do. And these are baskets of -- the real risk is in producing wells, cash flows are down. Surprisingly, the cost of getting the oil out of the ground has also dropped dramatically, and probably much more than most of us would have expected. So, you take these producing wells, you take the cash flow, you discount it at 8% or 9%, you lend against it. And so these are our forecasts. And our energy book isn't that large, relative to JPMorgan Chase. We're not worried about the big oil companies. These are mostly the smaller ones that you're talking about these reserve increases on.
MARIANNE LAKE: I also think, Mike, just -JAMIE DIMON: And the forward curve is -- the end of the year, for 2016, I think is more like [$41] or [$42], or something like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's [$48]. So, hey, Mike, the other thing to know about the profile of reserves -- three things. The first is, it's not linear. So, just the oil price decline, and the decline in the forward curve that we saw into December and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves. It's fallen significantly in the first two quarters. That was not a knowable condition, and we can't reserve for that at the end of the year. That's why we said we would expect to take some more reserve increases in the next couple of quarters. But again, it's a name-specific thing. And lots of other conditions at clients matter, including their hedging, their cash flows, the level of security, all those things.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, the oil folks have been surprisingly resilient. And remember, these are asset-backed loans, so a bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean your loan is bad. So, you have to be a little bit careful in -- and it's also, Mike, a philosophical thing. A bank is supposed to be there for clients in good times and bad times. So, it's not a trading market, where you try to support clients. So, to the extent we can responsibly support clients, we're going to. And if we lose a little bit more money because of it, so be it. And we've done that around the world. We did it in 2007 and 2008 and 2009. We try to do it responsibly. If banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, let me just deal with where we are against our targets. So, the most notable targets were $2 billion in the Consumer businesses in 2017 versus 2014, and $2.8 billion in the CIB in 2017 versus 2014. You probably heard my comment, but to clarify, on an apples-to-apples basis, we're halfway through on Consumer. We've done $1 billion this year. You don't see that 100% translate into the results, partly because of legal expense, which is not something that we particularly can predict, and hopefully won't be there forever. Also, because we intentionally decisioned in 2015, in the fourth quarter in particular, or mostly, to increase our investments in the Consumer businesses by $150 million. So, we've achieved the $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a portion of it. Another $1 billion we're on track for. We will potentially reinvest some of that, too. And Gordon and we will talk to you about the basis for that at Investor Day. On the $2.8 billion in the CIB, we're $1.3 billion through at the end of the year. And we talked before about the fact that the first $1.3 billion is largely on business simplification. We've had the revenue decline. We need to have the expense decline, and we've worked hard to deliver that, and we have. The next chunk is to do with technology and operations and infrastructure and organization, and it's harder. And so, we will continue with them on track to deliver it, but it's going to be a job through 2016 and into 2017.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I can give you some thoughts that won't totally satisfy you, which is our core expenses will continue to trend down, on the back of delivering against them. But we will make investment decisions that we think are good for the Company, accretive for shareholders, that will re-spend some of that money. And so we'll give you that shrink and grow at Investor Day.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, just on NII, yes, we are seeing, embedded in that NII, flat to up slightly. We are seeing a nice lift associated with the rate hike in December across businesses, as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards loans in our balance sheet. But we were flatted in our NII this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in CIO. So, that's going to mean the comparison is challenging, and then day count is obviously seasonal. So, that's the dynamic. We are seeing the rate benefit. We do expect to see it, as I said in my remarks, for the full year. Look, we think we are appropriately conservative on deposit [beta's]. It is not -- it is way too early to have any idea. There's -- virtually nothing has moved yet. And so, our job, and what we are doing, is paying very close attention to the competitive landscape. These deposits that we're talking about, that have the high beta's, are valuable deposits with valuable clients for us, and we want to be competitive and pay fair rates. But it's so early in the movie that we haven't changed much in our modeling assumptions.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, energy, Metals & Mining, we're watching very closely, industries that could have knock-on effects like industrials and transportation. But we're not seeing anything broadly, in our portfolio, right now. We're just watching very closely, which is why -- now, obviously, you can take our reserve build number, and you can say it's almost substantially all made up of Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining. And behind the scenes, we've had upgrades and downgrades of a number of other different companies, across sectors, but nothing particularly thematic yet. But we're watching.
JAMIE DIMON: I would just point our that Credit Card, Commercial Bank, middle market, large corporate credit is as good as it's ever been. So obviously, it's going to get a little bit worse. I wouldn't call it a cycle, per se. If you have a recession, yes, you will see a normal cyclical increase in all those losses. We're not forecasting a recession. We think that the US economy looks pretty good at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, look, we talked about achieving 4% last quarter, I think; and for disclosure, we were quite close to 3.5%. At that point, it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin, for what you could do to get within the bucket. And so that is what we did in the fourth quarter, is spend time really focusing on getting to that achievable boundary, which we thought at that point it was. And remember, it's not nothing, in the year, that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits. And while there still could be some volatility in that number, of course, we've almost doubled that -- or doubled that, in fact. So, we got some wind to our backs in doing it. It's also the case that, when you get the entire Business and Company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that, at the margin, in a 100 different things, little benefits accrue. So, look, we're at about 3.5% -- we're just inside the 3.5% bucket, as best we estimate it. It's not as much important whether we're basis points or surcharge points below or above. It's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket. And that's going to still take work. So that's why -- we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day. In terms of the give-up, from an economics perspective, we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because we think it is important to do, because we think it's going to be constructive for the Company, and because the revenue give-ups were not significant. But they weren't zero, either. But to be able to reduce a constraint that is, in one way or another, likely to bind us -- or in multiple ways, in fact, likely to bind us, it was a, I think, very good trade.
JAMIE DIMON: It was done, effectively, client by client.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: To make sure we were trying to do the right things for our clients; not just jamming our balance sheet down and hurting people.
JAMIE DIMON: The US economy has been chugging along at 2% to 2.5% growth for the better part of five years now. In the last two years, it has created 5 million jobs. If you look at the actual household formation -- car sales, wage, people working -- it still looks okay. Corporate credit is quite good. Small business formation -- it's not back to where it was, but it's quite good. Household formation's going up. So obviously, market turmoil, we all look at it every day. But I'm not sure most of the 143 million Americans look at it that much, who have jobs; and you have a big change in the world out there. People are getting adjusted to China slowing down. When you have commodity prices go down like that, there are big winners and losers. The oil companies are the losers; consumer is a benefit. Brazil gets hurt. India benefits. South Korea benefits. Japan benefits. And those cause troubling waters. And hopefully, this will all settle down, and it's not the beginning of something really bad.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So our total reserves, on balance sheet, for Metals & Mining, or notwithstanding we built $60 million-odd this year, is over $200 million. So the coverage ratio is pretty good. The exposure is about -- I haven't got the precise numbers in front of me. They're [about] a third the size of our exposure to Oil & Gas, so about 2% of our overall wholesale credit exposure; so, considerably more modest. Which is why, if energy prices and general commodities weakness and stress stayed where it is right now, even for an extended period, we would think that the incremental reserves would be considerably more modest.
JAMIE DIMON: And it's also -- that one is mostly name by name.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, for sure.
JAMIE DIMON: It's not big asset-based reserves. It's just -- they're big corporate credits, name by name.
MARIANNE LAKE: And for both Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining in our portfolio, Oil & Gas is close to 60% investment grade, and Metals & Mining about half.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, with respect to home equity [re-class], remember, the majority of the problematic home equity underwriting was 2005 through 2008. So here we are, at the beginning of 2016, with [pig filling the python]. But we're monitoring it closely, and we have some re-class that have happened. Obviously, interest rates are low. Home price appreciation, on the other hand, is your friend. So there are puts and takes. We've been monitoring it, I would say, at the margin, or more than at the margin, at the early stages, coming in better than we had modeled. And remember, from an incurred loss perspective, we would consider these re-class risks to be largely incurred, so we've tried to reserve them, to the best of our ability. So we feel good about our reserve. I don't think we've disclosed them. But so far, from a performance perspective, I would say slightly better than our models. But we continue to monitor it, because it's still relatively early.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously, you'll forgive me because we've been on calls since it came out. But, yes, we have been working on this for years. The problem with this particular rule is that, as you stated, based upon the four QIS's that were done, there were some, I would characterize, significant challenges, with respect to the rules as written. And we were expecting there to be a number of meaningful changes, and there have been; in many cases, meaningful improvements. But it's very technical, and there's been a lot of changes, so we need to sift through it to figure out, net-net everything. Although it is clear that net-net, despite the fact of the stated intention of the committee wasn't necessary to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher. But by how much, it's really going to need to be sifted through. And for that same reason -- for both those same reasons, I'm sorry -- for the reason that the rule has not been stable and there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed, and many, I guess, that have not, it would have been premature to have taken any actions in advance of figuring out where this has landed. And, as you know, the period to comply is three years. So it's more of a start from here, to figure out how to manage with this, after we've sifted through the details. So, I wish I were able to give you a little bit more of a detailed answer, but we're going to need to take the time to go through it.
MARIANNE LAKE: There are always actions that we can take to reduce the impact. And so, we have to think about them in the context of our overall capital optimization program. And, again, if there are -- if some of the things that we hoped -- and I -- honestly, I've been on calls since it came out. So, if some of the things that we hoped were going to be addressed have not, they could have had, or may have, meaningful impact on specific types of activity. And we will have to react accordingly. And, yes, we will take actions, if that's the right answer. I wish I could give you more details, but we just need to go through it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, I would say that, based upon our fourth-quarter balance sheet, given that market risk was a driver, given that balance sheet levels was a driver, particularly on standardized, we could give back, on standardized, as much as 10 to 20 bps of capital, of the 10.7% capital accretion. But the bigger point, on the RWA outlook, is that we expect to be bound, over the medium term, by standardized. And standardized is going to always have a neutral to upwards pressure, as we continue to grow these high-quality loans. So, even though the RWA, being at the $1.5 trillion-ish sooner than we expected, is obviously good news. Regardless of how much of that may, in the short term, revert, our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient, to try and keep it there, just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. We can become more efficient in advance, but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. So, that's what we're focused on. So, I wouldn't take the $1.5 trillion, and read through that we'll be continuing to decline from here on standardized. We'll be continuing to work hard to make sure that we can grow those loans that we love, but that have (inaudible) [risk weights] under a standardized basis.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. If I miss something at the end, remind me. In terms of how we think about buffers, just really conceptually, the Firm manages, and the Board has set for the Firm, a risk appetite. That risk appetite has a number of features, and capital depletion in a stressed environment is one of them. And so, when we think about setting buffers, we think about it just broadly in the context of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses that are within our risk appetite, and not have to take premature actions, from a capital perspective. So -- but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent, at the 50-basis-point level, for a reasonable period of time. And we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. With respect to our targets, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulatory capital, because as you say, we're bound, potentially, by multiple constraints, and one of them may be CCAR. Plus -- it is CCAR, I should say. Because as you know, the first two quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved. And we haven't done CCAR, so this is not any kind of prediction, but it wouldn't surprise you to know that it's unlikely that we will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR, going forward. So, we are on a path to continue to accrete capital, though we would like to move up in our pay-out range. So, given that we're still moving towards our 12% target, and we will update you if any of that changes at Investor Day. We're also, as you know, potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters, and whether that has an impact. So, at the moment, the best we know is that we're going to continue to accrete capital, albeit more slowly, as we hope to move up in the pay-out range, but we haven't done CCAR yet. And that's if the rules don't change. So, 12% it is for now.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's both. So, think about -- in a [rate-sat] scenario, when you can pick whether you believe the market -- whether you think the market is -- or whether you believe the [FONC docs]. And I think it's going to be data dependent, so we're not going to have a stated opinion on that. But because of the mix in our balance sheet in 2015, as well as our expectation of continued loan growth, we would expect mix to contribute about half of that. And defer 25 basis points about the next half because we are more sensitive to the front end of rates in the first 25 basis points. And you can see that in our earnings and risk disclosures. So -- even if we see nothing else. Now, obviously, we believe, and the market believes that you're going to see a couple more hikes. That would be, on average, another 25 basis points, and that would be incremental NII again.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say I would think about them in a somewhat similar directional way, given that our balance sheet ended below $2.4 trillion, a little bit of it market delivered, a lot of it purposeful. But we do intend to continue to gather deposits and extend loans, and while you're -- and portfolio loans, as well. So, while you will see some securities balances decline and the like, I would say again, net modest growth, but modest, and very lending driven.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So, in terms of the impact of rates, obviously there was a lot of monetary policy confusion. Broadly, in the fourth quarter, the ECB underwhelmed the Fed, was (inaudible). So there was a lot of confusion. But by the time the rate hike happened, it was obviously pretty well understood. We did see strong activity, or strong client activity, relatively speaking, on the back of that in the rates business, more so than necessarily about spreads. With respect to the Fixed Income business, we've always been very disciplined about how we think about the staffing levels and the expenses in that business. We've managed it very carefully. The compensation has come down across the trading businesses, and it wouldn't surprise you that some of that -- a lot of that has been in
JAMIE DIMON: You've seen, in Fixed Income -- we have a very good Fixed Income operation globally, around the world. Rates themselves don't filter through FICC trading directly. I think what Danny was talking about is, if you have healthy economies and confident investors, you have more volume in things like that. We do see a little bit of repricing taking place, in prime broker, repo, conduit, and some of those things run through FICC. So, that is going to take place as the world adjusts to all the new capital requirements. And obviously, there's a lot of seasonality in the business, which we've experienced for the last decade.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks, Erika.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we've seen no real repricing in loans on the balance sheet. You have seen a little bit of -people are getting other revenues to make up for their credit exposure.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Think about the bank loans as being relationship loans that need to be in the context of [broader] relationship, and everybody is competing for them.
JAMIE DIMON: They barely repriced in 2008 and 2009. Banks were continuing to lend at the existing price. But that was because they -- these were long-term relationships. The bank loan market does not reprice like the markets do.
JAMIE DIMON: We haven't seen it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Also, it's very, very competitive. Everybody has been chasing these loans, and so that's a factor, too. So, we haven't seen it yet.
JAMIE DIMON: And then, if you -- the number in middle market lending, if I remember correctly, if you look at it by client, 60% of the revenues are not loan related. So, clients -- they also know what their relationship is to the bank. And while we need to make a good return on capital, the capital applied to the client is only partially loan related. And that capital, on its own, doesn't earn an adequate return. Simple lending, on its own, is generally not an adequate return business.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the better way to look at it is that people seem, in certain of our businesses -- and I mentioned those, and there are some other ones -- capital has been deployed, people have adjusted to the new rules, and you've seen pricing go up. Whether it goes up a lot -- I wouldn't count on it going up a lot more from there. The markets are going to be competitive at that point. But use of balance sheet, the cost has gone up; not loans, but most of the other stuff.
MARIANNE LAKE: And remember, we think about our prime brokerage business going hand in glove with equity.
JAMIE DIMON: That's correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: And so, while the repricing is helpful, and does -- at the margin, everybody is going to continue to always observe their pricing. We've built our platform internationally; Europe, we are seeing strong demand for our [synthetic pull-outs]. In Asia, we're adding clients -- we've got the wind to our backs. So, it's an important business to our clients. You're right, there are some other people, potentially, not going to be as aggressive. And if we can take share, we certainly will.
MARIANNE LAKE: Obviously, we expect any transition adjustment to go through equity. If we are able to adopt it early, we might do that. I'm not aware that we are. But I could be wrong about that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, yes, obviously, it was -- I think if you add up [cleared plus] other servicing rules, print them out, put them on the floor and stand them next to me, they're a foot taller. So they are very complicated. There's a lot of operational complexity to complying, and we're working very hard at doing that. I will say, in the quarter, we did -- as part of being cautious about making sure that we're complying, our cycle times were a couple days -- a few days worsened. And so, volumes, our origination volumes, are a little lower than we would have otherwise seen; not a lot. And that's just timing, and it's just days. But not really from a financial results perspective, because of the way we recognize the revenue. So, I would call it a little bit of teething problems -- across the industry, by the way, not just us -- nothing significant. We are going to get the work finished, and so it's tough, but it is what it is.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, it's about 60% jumbo, 40% agency or conventional conforming, and it's a better execution decision. So, when we look at the better economics between selling or portfolio-ing the mortgage, we'll generally choose the better economics. But we also prefer the annuity nature of the NII -- the lower servicing risk, and the better capital efficiency. So, it has been the case, over the course of the last several quarters, that it has been the best execution to portfolio these mortgages. And actually, they are generating a nice return on equity.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we have had pretty big tax gains over the course of the last -- most notably, obviously, last quarter, over the course of the last couple of years. Most of those related to the, call it, 2003 through 2008 tax periods, when we were going through the financial crisis. And so, some of the matters were more complex, and we took appropriate reserving decisions on that. There are many less of those very complicated matters ahead of us, and so we wouldn't expect to see the same sort of size of tax benefits going forward as we've seen in the past. But we had some this quarter. So, we'll have a few. And generally speaking, they are, because of the nature of the reserving for tax, generally speaking, we take a conservative approach and the bias to the positive. But it could be much more plus or minus zero, at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Brian.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, do I think it's plateaued? I think it remains incredibly competitive in card generally, in particular in the co-brand space. So, plateaued at a very competitive level, I suppose. But in terms of -- I'm not going to talk about any specific names, actually, Brian, in terms of the potential for repricing. It's an important part of our Business, and we're going to defend our Business.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Gerard.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's a Board decision, and so, neither have we received that guidance from the regulators, nor have we done CCAR, and had that discussion yet with the Board. But we have generally said that the Board likes to have the flexibility to increase dividends over time, and we have had our dividend most recently at or close to that soft cap. So, we would love that capacity, and I would imagine that, over time, it may be used. But again, it is a Board decision, not a management decision.
MARIANNE LAKE: From -- we do everything pro forma. So, first of all, I would say the following. Right now, my understanding -- and if I'm wrong, forgive me -- is that it's your spot balance sheet two years prior that would drive your G-SIB two years forward. But the reality, if you ask my opinion, given that we're going to be reporting quarterly going forward, and because of the likelihood that G-SIB may or may not feature into CCAR, I think it's going to be less important, necessarily, what you are at any one moment in time, but where you are projecting to be or stay. So, I suspect that we will get the benefit, potentially, of this, not today. We just closed our balance sheet. But I think that it's going to need to be a little bit more dynamic going forward, as it gets potentially introduced into stress test.
MARIANNE LAKE: But I don't know that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, everyone.",0.07000000000000006,-0.1610000000000007,0,0.09631898294276021,0.12201600419782237
9,Q4_2014,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements, which is at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $4.9 billion and EPS of $1.19 and a return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.6 billion of revenue for the quarter. Included in our results was total legal expense of $1.1 billion or approximately $1 billion after tax. In large part an incremental amount for FX. As we go through the presentation, I will call out other notable items. For your reference, we've included the EPS impact of those here on the front page. In total, they contributed a net positive $0.12 to EPS. So adjusting for legal expense, as well as these items, gives net income of $5.5 billion and an EPS of $1.33 reflecting solid core performance. I'm going to skip over page 2 and we're going to go straight to the full-year results on page 3. The firm reported record net income of nearly $22 billion and record EPS of $5.29 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on nearly $98 billion of revenue. Excluding legal expense, which remains elevated, net income for the year was $24 billion and return on tangible common equity 14%. You can see on the page at the bottom that adjusted expense was $58.4 billion, in line with guidance and down $650 million from the prior year despite the impact of incremental cost control, as well as continuing to invest in our businesses. A final couple of points for the year, core loan growth was strong at 8% year-on-year and net capital distributions for the year were approximately $10 billion, including record dividends of $6 billion. Turning to page 4, the firm's fully phased in advanced CET1 ratio was 10.1%, flat to last quarter with earnings and portfolio runoff offset by capital distributions and an increase in risk-weighted assets predominantly driven by higher counterparty credit risk. In terms of 2015 outlook, we expect to add 50 basis points or more to this ratio. Similarly, the firm's fully phased in standardized ratio not on the page also remained flat at 10.5%. The firm's SLR was 5.6% and the bank's SLR improved to 5.9%. And given the recent FSB proposal, we've added our best estimate of TLAC at approximately 15%, excluding buffers, which will be refined as the rules are finalized. Moving on to page 5 and before we move into each of the businesses, this quarter, we've changed the presentation of preferred dividends in our lines of business and show the impact here on the page. For the Company, preferred dividends were and continue to be below the line; however, we've historically allocated the cost of preferred stock to the businesses as a net interest expense or a contra revenue with a corresponding positive impact in corporate NII. In order to have cleaner trends and better peer comparability, we're now presenting preferred dividends below the line for each of our LOBs, which is particularly important given recent increases in preferred issuance. You can see on the slide the change in methodology has no impact on firm-wide financials nor on LOB returns on equity. While LOB revenue, net income and overhead ratios improve, additionally the adjustment affects the contra revenue ratio in the CIB. So from here throughout this presentation and also in the supplement, all numbers in all periods consistently reflect this change. Moving on to business performance on page 6, the Consumer & Community Bank. The combined businesses generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter and an ROE of 16% on nearly $11 billion of revenue. Excluding the impact of losses related to noncore portfolio exits in Card, the ROE was 18%. Consumer & Community Banking continues to deliver strong underlying performance, maintaining our number one ranking in customer satisfaction among largest banks for the third year in a row by ACSI. And in addition, we continue to deepen relationships with our customers. Average deposits were up 8% year-on-year with growth across regions and markets. Record client investment assets were up 13%. Our active mobile customer base was up 22% and credit card sales volume was up 10% on strong new account originations. Across CCB, we've outperformed our expense targets for the year and have reduced headcount by 12,000 this year exceeding Investor Day guidance by roughly 4,000 and over the last three years, headcount is down approximately 32,000 across the consumer businesses. Turning to page 7, Consumer & Business Banking. For the fourth quarter, CBB generated net income of $861 million, up 8% year-on-year and an ROE of 31% on improved operating leverage. Net interest income was relatively flat year-on-year, but down slightly quarter-on-quarter on lower deposit margin. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect continued spread compression in CBB deposit margin driven by lower reinvestment rates will drive a modest decline in NII quarter-over-quarter. Noninterest revenue continued to grow, up 6%, across investment, debit and other fees with the addition of approximately 700,000 net new households. And expense was relatively flat with efficiencies self-funding investments. Finally, in Business Banking, the momentum we have seen in recent quarters continued with loan originations for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up 18% year-on-year. Businesses remain relatively optimistic and banker performance continues to improve. Mortgage Banking on page 8. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $338 million for the quarter and a 7% ROE. We reduced expenses for the year by $2.3 billion, outperforming our $2 billion target. Moving to the top of the page, production pre-tax income, excluding repurchase, was slightly positive for the quarter, which was better than guidance on higher volumes and revenue margins. The origination market was more robust due to a strong rate rally, but we estimate it was down about 5% quarter-on-quarter seasonally against which our originations were $23 billion, up 8% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting corresponding share gains in jumbo and conventional. So this quarter, we increased volumes, we gained approximately 100 basis points of marketshare estimated and realized higher revenue margin. Expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter despite the increase in volumes as we continue to focus on controlling costs. On to Servicing, net Servicing-related revenue of $624 million was down slightly quarter-on-quarter on lower balances with Servicing expense of $560 million also down slightly. On Real Estate Portfolios, we continue to add high-quality loans to our portfolio. We added another $10 billion this quarter, up from $7 billion last quarter. We recorded net charge-offs of $111 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio. Lastly, headcount was down over 7,500 for the year and approximately 22,000 over the last three years. Moving on to page 9, Card, Merchant Services & Auto net income of $980 million, down 7% year-on-year with an ROE of 20%. If you exclude reserve releases, net income was up 2%. The strong momentum in our business continues with very strong spend, as well as card balance growth of $3 billion in the year. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 4% year-on-year, but up 1% adjusting for losses related to portfolio exits that went through the quarter's results with an adjusted revenue rate for Card shown on the page of 12.2%, in line with our guidance. Strong loan and sales growth was offset by spread compression and higher acquisition costs as we continue to add more customers. In 2015, expect the revenue rate to remain at the low end of our target range of 12% to 12.5%. Expense was down 6% year-on-year predominantly driven by remediation costs included in the prior period. In Card, we led the industry for the 27th consecutive quarter gaining nearly 500 basis points of share during the same period. This quarter, we saw sales growth of 10% driven by enhanced client acquisition and reward strategies. In Merchant Services, volume was up 13% year-on-year driven by continued strong sales performance and in Auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales, as well as stable used-car values. This was the 13th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 5% year-on-year. Coming into this year, the pipeline is strong, which reflects continued strength in the Auto market. Finally on Credit, in Card, we continued to see improvements in early delinquencies and we released $150 million of reserves this quarter. You can see the net charge-off rate adjusted for portfolio exits was down slightly at 248 basis points. In 2015, expect the charge-off rate to decline modestly. For Auto, credit losses were higher on balance growth and as the charge-off rate starts to trend up from historical lows. Now moving on to page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $972 million and an ROE of 5% on $7.4 billion of revenue for the quarter. Adjusting for legal expense, ROE would have been 11% for the quarter and 13% for the year. In banking, IBCs were $1.8 billion, up 8%. We continue to rank number one in global IBCs per Dealogic, number one in the US and we moved up to number one in EMEA this year. Record debt underwriting was driven by M&A-related financings. Strong advisory fees for the quarter contributed to the full-year increase, up 24% and equity underwriting fees were down from a strong quarter last year, but in line with the overall decline in market issuance. We continue to [book on] more deals than any other firm for both the quarter and the year and the fee pipeline continues to be strong into 2015 with a favorable environment generally across most products. Treasury Services revenue was up 3% and lending-related revenue was $264 million, was down $129 million year-on-year given mark-to-market gains in the prior year. Moving on to Markets revenues of $3.6 billion, down 13% year-on-year, but as guided, excluding business simplification, the core business was down 5%. Fixed Income was $2.5 billion, down 14% excluding business simplification driven primarily by lower results in credit-related and securitized products and with rate markets remaining challenging. However, currencies in emerging markets had a strong quarter with higher volatility leading to increased client activity as our remaining financial commodities business is doing well. In Equities, we saw strong performance for the quarter, up 25% year-on-year at $1.1 billion. Derivatives was very strong, one of the best fourth quarters in recent years, largely driven by Asia as client activity increased on central bank actions. Cash was solid driven primarily by EMEA on the back of strong ECM results. With respect to Markets revenues for the first quarter of 2015, business simplification will continue to drive a negative year-on-year variant for the quarter, approximately $500 million or 10% with a corresponding expense decline of approximately $300 million. Security Services revenues of $1.1 billion was up 6% year-on-year, including higher NII on higher average deposits. Assets under custody were $20.5 trillion, flat year-on-year with market appreciation largely offset by a significant client exit. Credit Adjustments & Other shows a loss driven by net CVA losses, as well as the inclusion of nonrecurring DVA/FVA valuation adjustments totaling approximately $200 million. Moving on to Expenses, total expenses up 14% year-on-year, compensation was down 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and down 4% for the year with a comp to revenue ratio for the year of 30%. The increase is driven by noncomp expense primarily by over $900 million of legal expense, as well as higher control-related expenses with those being partially offset by business simplification. Moving on to Commercial Banking on page 11, this quarter saw net income of $693 million with an ROE of 19% on $1.8 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 4% sequentially and flat year-on-year, excluding the one-time proceeds of $100 million from a lending-related workout that was included in the prior year. Continued yield compression in our lending book, as well as the impact of business simplification is being offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Quarter-on-quarter, revenues increased on better fee revenue and it was an incredible story for investment banking this quarter with record gross revenue of $557 million, up 11% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. For the full year, Commercial Banking clients generated $2 billion of investment banking revenues for the firm, reaching our goal. Expense is in line with guidance, slightly higher year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter due to the ongoing investment in controls. In loan balances, we saw an increase of $4.7 billion, our best quarter of growth since 2011, driven by strong performance in our commercial real estate businesses, as well as growth in the C&I portfolio this quarter. Our CRE book has now grown for 15 consecutive quarters and for the quarter grew 4% ahead of the industry. C&I loans grew 3% this quarter, in line with the industry and with pipelines remaining solid. Finally, in terms of credit performance, an exceptional year, another single-digit net charge-off rate for the quarter at 8 basis points and a slight net recovery position for the full year. Moving on to page 12, a solid quarter in Asset Management with net income of $540 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. Last year included a mark-to-market gain of approximately $100 million. Adjusting for that revenue was up 4%, expense of $2.3 billion was up 3% and net income up 5% on positive operating leverage. This quarter marks the 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows at $10 billion driving AUM of $1.7 trillion, up 9% year-on-year and we achieved the number one ranking in 2014 for global net inflows in active long-term mutual funds. We continue to see strength in our multi-asset and fixed income flows and although smaller equity inflows outpaced the industry. Banking had record loan balances up 11% year-on-year with growth coming from both US and international markets and record deposits up 6%. As reported, client assets of $2.4 trillion were up 2% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, but excluding business simplification, client assets would've been up 8% year-on-year. Lastly, for the full year, we saw continued strong investment performance. This was the second consecutive year of long-term net inflows of over $80 billion, driving a fifth year of record revenue and a second year of record net income with 23% ROE and 29% pre-tax margin. AUM loans and deposits were also records for the year. Turning to page 13, Corporate and Private Equity. Private Equity reported $107 million of net income primarily driven by Private Equity gains of approximately $450 million, partially offset by a little over $200 million of related goodwill impairments. This past Friday, we completed the spinout of One Equity Partners and the investment professionals have formed a new independent company, OEP Capital Advisors. At the same time, we closed on the sale of a portion of our private equity portfolio to a group of private equity firms. OEP Capital Advisors will continue to manage both the investments we've sold, as well as the investments we've retained and closing this transaction had no significant impact to fourth-quarter financials. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $205 million, but remember this is after the impact of the change in how we allocate preferred dividends. Firm NII was $11.3 billion, flat quarter-on-quarter. And finally in Other Corporate, net income was $645 million. Included in this result were tax-related benefits of approximately $500 million, partially offset by a contribution we made to our foundation of approximately $150 million and close to $100 million pre-tax of legal expense. So to wrap up, 2014 was a record year for both net income and EPS with a 13% return on tangible common equity despite elevated legal expense and despite headwinds from capital markets, mortgage and the low interest rate environment. We maintained excellent customer satisfaction results and we gained share in many of our businesses. Delivered on our commitments, including business simplification, controls and expense discipline and we also met our capital targets for the year while returning $10 billion of net capital to shareholders. So with that, we'll open up to Q&A, operator, if you could open up the line. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: So, Betsy, obviously two things. The first thing is that the most important time period when this is going to matter is when it's in full compliance and through the transition period in 2017 and 2018. So the result in the 450 bucket as we understand it is based on 2013 results, so we have to work over the course of the next three years to make sure we are maximizing every basis point of G-SIB and every dollar of capital to the fullest extent to deliver returns. So rather say that to move down a bucket, just in general terms, is a fairly significant thing to do just given the types of things that are driving the overall score, but we're not complacent about it. We've worked in extreme granularity to make sure that from the very first basis point that we're certain we're maximizing the return opportunity for that within the context of the bucket we're in. So it would not be a trivial exercise to move down, but we're focused on making sure that we're optimizing the resources that is our most binding constraint.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's probably worth mentioning that while we were in or looked like we might be in the highest bucket relative to our peers, there were peers that were in higher buckets and they are not constrained by G-SIB but by CCAR. So it's likely to be the case -- we continue to believe it's likely to be the case that you're going to see the differential in required capital for a variety of reasons not being as wide as might be implied by the G-SIB. And so the key question is whether we're delivering the right shareholder value on the incremental capital, which we clearly think we are and can continue to do. And so it is a -- we are trying to thread the needle, as you say, about making sure that we are as focused as we can on maximizing the use of that scarce resource, but within the bucket that we end up being, wherever that might be, that our key priority is to deliver the highest ROE and shareholder value we can, particularly in a world where others may be more constrained by balance sheet or leverage. So it is a fine dance and it's what we're working through. We'll obviously keep you updated as we continue to progress our plans.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, 50 basis points or possibly more.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, so let me start at the beginning, which is if you look at our Basel III advanced RWA on the slide, it's just a little over $1.6 trillion. When we were at Investor Day last year, we said that we expected to be able to provide reductions to that by the end of 2015 to get the number closer to $1.5 trillion on the back of model-related benefits, etc. It's still the case that that's the direction we will move in. Whether we get exactly to $1.5 trillion or slightly over will depend on the timing of some of those benefits. But that's directionally where we're going. So call it from a little over $1.6 trillion to a little over $1.5 trillion and we'll give you an update at Investor Day. With respect to the assumptions, at the end of the day, we generate a lot of capital and if we need to comply more quickly than we intend to do, then we can clearly pull those levers. But we have always over the last couple of years had the approach of wanting to have a reasonable sense of urgency, but a measured pace to getting to where we need to be over the course of a transition period, as well as preserving the optionality to continue to increase dividends and do buybacks. That continues to be generally our philosophy and if you take -- I think I said this before. Don't read anything into this with respect to capital asks or anything else, but if you take analysts' estimates for the next two, three years, take a $1.5 trillion or even slightly higher RWA basis, you can continue to add 50 basis points of capital a year, as well as have meaningful buyback and capital distribution capacity and 50 basis points a year from a little over 10% over three or four years gets you to the other side of 11.5%. So that's just an illustration of the capacity we have; not necessarily a commitment in terms of glide path, but that's the basis upon which we feel like we will be able to add 50 basis points this year, which is, on a fully phased in advanced basis, which is we think an appropriate glide path.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: And we haven't really started to manage [E-SIFI], which we're going to do too now.
JAMIE DIMON: John, she didn't say that.
MARIANNE LAKE: John --.
JAMIE DIMON: We're going to meet our common Tier 1 with the buffer we think is appropriate and we're going to fill the rest of TLAC with the debt, subordinate debt and preferred we need to.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think, John, if there's something you're looking at that we've confused you, I apologize for that. For the purpose of clarity, we expect to grow into our GSIB buffer, which will be excluded from TLAC with common equity and whatever the gap may be when the rules are finalized on TLAC, somewhere between nothing and something more meaningful, that's likely to be in debt issuance.
MARIANNE LAKE: I apologize. We'll take a look at that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Guy, what the reserves that we have taken in the quarter represent is our best estimate based upon facts and circumstances as we know them at the end of the quarter with respect to ongoing dialogue and investigations, but they are not concluded. So as much as we would like to, we can give you no assurances with respect to the final conclusion and that's really all we can say about where we are on the FX matter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Just one quick thing on NIM before I talk about expenses. We don't manage to NIM. NIM can be reasonably volatile purely as a feature the amount of cash that we have on our balance sheet. What you saw this quarter in terms of NIM, which was a 5 or 6 basis point decline, whether you are looking at firm or core, is in very large part driven by incremental cash balances of close to $50 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: Which (inaudible) there for days.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. Some of which is there for days, some of which is accretive from an NII perspective, albeit modestly. So I think the more important measure, for us anyway, quarter-over-quarter is that our NII was flat, but flat and then just in terms of the flattening yield curve, we are more geared towards a short-end rates move and we're still expecting that to happen in the second half of the year. And so what really matters for us is Fed funds rate notwithstanding the overall yield curve. With respect to expenses, yes, we will give you more updates at Investor Day, but I can continue to reiterate what we've said in the past, which is we would continue to expect to push our adjusted expense absolute dollars downwards over the course of the next several years and in combination with hopefully an improving economy and better interest rates move towards the 55% plus or minus, but 55% overhead ratio over the medium term. So you should expect our adjusted expenses in 2015 to be down, but we continue to have, albeit that we've reached a peak in the second half of the year, we continue to have elevated cost of controls and some of that leverage will be more in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015.
MARIANNE LAKE: So a little bit of what's driving the efficiency ratio in the second half versus the first half is seasonality in revenues and year-on-year revenues were down slightly. So obviously it's a little bit elevated relative to a 59% to 60% ratio, but obviously the absolute dollars are on a downward trend. Hopefully what we're going to see in combination over the course of the next year or two is we will continue to look at efficiency in our control spend. As I say, we're going to be looking at that in 2015 relative to the exit 2014 rate, but you're going to see more of that leverage in 2016 and 2017. We'll continue to bring mortgage costs down, cost within the branches down, but offsetting against that hopefully we'll have stronger performance in some of our businesses and show some expense growth. So overall trending down, but revenues are part of the story and they were down slightly year-on-year.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Mike, we'll give you the lowdown of that at Investor Day. You will see absolute reduction in dollars and we'll give you the outlook for the efficiency ratio then.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say a bit of both actually. So obviously, as you articulate, we do see seasonality, but we did reach an inflection point during the year where we're starting to see a little bit more demand anyway for credit extension, but I would say our outlook for Credit Card outstandings growth for 2015 is modest, low single digit growth, not higher than that. So a little bit of both, but we are flattered by seasonality in terms of the fourth quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: So JPMorgan, taking it in three pieces, yes, we think it's very good for the consumer on balance and also for the economy on balance despite the strengthening dollar, so we think that the consumer spend, consumer even credit extension is likely to be positive as a result. From a trading perspective, there are pluses and minuses. The oil price volatility contributed to the softer quarter in the credit space, but was helpful as it related to the current season commodity space. So in fact, net-net neutral to maybe even slightly favorable. And then with respect to our traditional credit exposure to the sector, it's about 5% of our overall credit exposure. It's well secure, top of the capital structure where it's a name-by-name analysis that we do and we feel comfortable with where we are right now. It's a cyclical business and we're expecting downgrades, but we're not facing any meaningful issues in the face right now. But overall, oil a reasonable positive for the economy and consumers, so for JPMorgan from a financial perspective a modest issue, possibly more negative.
JAMIE DIMON: So first of all, I dispute the fact that some investors -- some people wrote about it as a possibility because of excess capital and it's true; you have to hold more capital, all things being equal, it will reduce your returns. But even the people who wrote about that talk about the superior franchises, the benefits of synergies, the good things the Company brings to bear. So the first way to look at a business first and foremost has been and always will be what you do for customers, not what you do for yourself and your own returns, etc. and on the customer franchise in every business we're gaining share. We have good returns, we've got good marketshares, we've got good customer sat levels. The synergies are huge, both expense and revenue synergies, etc. and some, not all, disappear under the various schematics of a breakup or something like that, but that's number one. And the question is now you are burying extra capital, how bad is that relative to that. And for the most part, we've been able to manage that. We've talked about products repricing and managing G-SIFI and managing CCAR and managing LCR and managing SLR and we're going to maintain the franchise, manage it and we still think we can get good returns. There's a point at which the capital drag would be so high that you may want to consider alternatives, but just remember they are not simple. Like anything you do, every company will have to have cash management, global trade ability, every company general ledgers and HR things and data centers and nerve data centers and cyber security and it isn't that simple a process. But so far, the Company has earned good returns in all those businesses throughout this crisis and I'm going back 2010, 2011, 2012 and that's a sign of stability. In fact, even Mike Mayo had a report, which there is a slide in it that shows the volatility of returns and that we were among the lowest with the better returns. So that is proving it. The model works from a business standpoint and yes, we'll have to carry more capital and we'll manage that over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Erika, just to add to that, we're still in a period of flux as it relates to broadly rules, not just capital rules and we're in a period of flux as it relates to the competitive environment and it would be, for us, it would be premature to take big strategic decisions that we don't think would add shareholder value in what is a very challenging influx and cyclical low for the environment. So we preserve optionality. We think we're generating significant shareholder value, significant synergies and any discount could erode regardless.
JAMIE DIMON: And remember the capital stuff is not an element -- what they are doing now is not a sign of riskiness; this Company has been a fortress company, it has delivered declines and its diversification is the reason why it's had less volatility of earnings and was able to go through the crisis and never lost money ever, not one quarter. So in the real-life crisis, we did fine and in any future crisis, we're going to do fine. There are a reason you have big global multinational banks and they serve big global multinational, including governments. This Company moves $6 trillion to $10 trillion a day; you're not going to do that as a small bank and you're not going to syndicate out of a $20 billion bridge loan and you can't do certain things globally in 20 countries if you aren't in 20 countries. So you've got to figure out what model you have and does it make sense and it's not necessarily comparable to all other companies. So our model makes sense because you've seen the returns in it.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you're right; the complexity bucket does stick out. Just for what it's worth, we're looking at each bucket and we're looking at it at a very granular level because obviously we need to look at the whole thing in combination and the complexity bucket -- Jamie said it I think earlier. If he didn't, I'll just repeat it. OTC derivative notionals drives a large chunk of it. Clearly, we're going to do everything we can in terms of netting and housekeeping and everything to reduce that. But to reduce that meaningfully is to have a meaningful impact on our client flow business. Level 3 assets is the second piece and obviously to the degree that those things are -- by definition, they are less liquid and so as a result --.
JAMIE DIMON: But that does not make them bad.
MARIANNE LAKE: That does not make them bad. They are just less liquid and as a result, we obviously will take a look at whether or not there's opportunity to reduce that. But, again, it's also relative to market size and then, finally, our AFS portfolio, which to have that in a complexity bucket is not intuitive to all of us and over time that may reduce but right now it's a very core part of how we think about structuring the interest rate risk management of our balance sheet. So we're going to look at it, but we're going to get very, very granular and there's no silver bullet.
JAMIE DIMON: I would guess that over years we can drive it down without damaging the franchise.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. It's about looking at the first 10, 20 basis points, not the last 3 or 4.
JAMIE DIMON: You mean commercial?
MARIANNE LAKE: So our exposures are about $46 billion, about 5% of our traditional Credit portfolio. About 70% of it is investment grade, about two-thirds of it is in the sort of CIB, so these are large, well-capitalized companies. The other third is in the Commercial Bank. Name by name, we understand what that looks like. These are asset-based loans, top of the capital structure, names we know and we're going to see downgrades and we're not suggesting that there isn't going to be some stress and we don't know where oil may bottom, but, yes, we do have reserves. We have reserves that are based upon a long history of data that includes cycles. We've seen cycles before like this and so we'll take downgrades, maybe we may need to take more reserves, but it doesn't feel like it's a very significant issue or an imminent series of charge-offs right now.
JAMIE DIMON: For us. There will be companies that are more invested in oil that may have different issues and then there's a secondary effect, which obviously you all can predict like Russia, Venezuela. So Russia, we have exposure; Venezuela, virtually none and other countries. And then there's another secondary effect. As you talked about, commercial or even consumer real estate in Dallas, Denver, Houston, as you saw in 1986 and 1989 and those are all slight negatives, but not again -- for us, they are not going to be material. We're very well-diversified and for us, you have the other side. In general, consumer credit would be better not worse and you can argue and I don't want to spend too much time on it that even retail would be better. There are a whole bunch of other beneficiaries of this change of credits. So some will be worse and some will be better, so net-net for us, it's not that big a deal. It's a perfectly legitimate thing for you all to be concerned about for companies, which are very concentrated in oil or even commercial real estate companies concentrated in oil areas. That's not something that we need to worry about.
MARIANNE LAKE: But we're watching it closely. To Jamie's point, we're paying attention to our Real Estate Portfolios in those geographies, so there's going to be overall sector and geographical differences to how this plays out and we're paying attention to that.
JAMIE DIMON: I'll give you an example of diversity helps.
JAMIE DIMON: Diversity helps. Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: On the first point, I think there's probably some truth to the less Liquidity, but it's more about oversupply and lack of global growth stimulating demand than it is I think a liquidity story from a capital markets perspective. Sorry, Jamie, you were going to --?
JAMIE DIMON: I would just add that when you look at -- I'm a little surprised that people are so surprised when commodities move like this. Commodities have moved like this my whole life and obviously there's supply and demand imbalance and Marianne mentioned that the United States supply has gone up by 5 million barrels a day over the last five or six years. People were a little surprised at the production that was positive out of Libya and Iran and Iraq and some other places. A lot of people need oil revenues, but the other thing that surprised people was the slightly increased demand. I say slightly out of China and some other places and the other one that surprised people is OPEC. Instead of OPEC making some kind of move to reduce supply, they didn't. But, to me, all commodities have had that kind of volatility and oil has had even more volatility, so in the oil business, you've got to prepare for something like that. That is the way it's going to be and that's the way it's going to be for the rest of your life and yes, speculations, inventory and all those things may affect it in the short run. Remember there is a fulcrum point at which oil, the marginal dollars that are going to be produced and I think our economists say it's about $75 oil, deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and around the world and one day it will recover to that because the world still will use more oil and need more oil, etc. and in the meantime, you've got to manage around the volatility and I don't think any of that had to do with trading, none of it. It had to do with fundamental supply/demand imbalances and people getting prepared for it and taking views on -- and not us. I mean I'm talking about oil companies and you've read about countries who've hedged it and countries who didn't and companies who hedged it and companies who didn't and I think it is a legitimate concern about liquidity in markets that when we have volatile markets or violent markets how much liquidity will remain, but I think there you're talking more about -- what you saw a little bit in treasuries, but more about credit and it's possible; we just don't really know. We're a little worried about it, but we will be there hopefully making healthy margins for our clients when the time comes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Obviously, we need to get clear on what the final rules and calculation looks like, but I don't see it being a blanket number. I think it's pretty evident that it's intended to be at least measured relative to the size -- it's the one measure that's not measured relative to a marketshare, but relative to the size of your operation. So consequently, depending upon how the math works out, it could be a differentiator for other people. But my comments were not necessarily driven by whether or not somebody else was going to be more punitive, more penalized by short-term wholesale funding, but by the fact that GSIB hasn't been and is unlikely to be the binding constraint for some of our competitors. For some of those, it's CCAR stress; for some, it's leverage under CCAR stress. And as a result, they already are running at or above the levels that may be implied and that may continue to increase. So here we have a situation where the transition period, the glide path is a four-year period. We're at 10.1 looking to put a glide path together that measures all of our objectives over the next few years where others are at or approaching 11%. So we will see obviously how that plays out in the medium term or in the short term I should say. Certainly in the short term we have a reasonably level playing field. The competitive landscape is changing and we're working very hard to make sure we're maximizing the return on every dollar we have.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, and the reason it went from 2.5 to 4 wasn't because of short-term wholesale funding; it was because they doubled -- they basically doubled the number under a new methodology. And so -- and I think when you spoke of 50 basis points of buffer, you weren't talking about a short-term wholesale funding buffer, you were talking about a buffer over the required number to handle volatility.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so the buffer, yes, totally volatility mainly AOTI-driven. The 50 basis points is the best estimate of what the short-term wholesale contribution --.
JAMIE DIMON: Added to it, yes. That is a GSIB requirement; that's not a buffer.
MARIANNE LAKE: But we'll see. My view is it's not a blanket though, so you could see some people differentiated in that sense.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously, if you get sort of granular --.
JAMIE DIMON: We've moved it to 3.1.
MARIANNE LAKE: Obviously if you get granular to different specific countries, we may have a different answer, but as a general matter, no. As a general matter for the US 2015 over 2014, we're calling for 2.5% and globally closer to 3%.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a tough question to answer. We have seen some pricing changes in trade finance a little bit in prime broker, not really in credit, but I do think you're going to see some of it in credit. So over time, that's not because of JPMorgan, that's just because the market is going to reprice some of these things that are more expensive to do and we do expect that will happen somewhat over time. And remember, the other thing which is really important is we manage this by client, so you can actually do a better job under LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR by client and not change pricing, just change mix. So we're working 100 different ways to figure out how to get good returns for shareholders while doing a good job for clients. And remember, we have more options to do that. So whenever we talk to a client, they are going to want some of our balance sheet capability and they may be willing to do other business with you to make sure they get it. Even if the pricing doesn't change, it might be good for us.
JAMIE DIMON: So let me address the Volcker rule in general. So we have accommodated the Volcker rule, which we have to do in private equity and investments in hedge funds and Marianne mentioned that we closed the sale of a couple billion dollars of private equity stuff and even the CLO issue is a very temporary thing. The only question to CLOs is should people be forced to sell it -- they are all going to run off in three to seven years. So the only question the bank -- and that's not a material issue to us. We're going to accommodate that. The other thing that's important about Volcker now is the remaining one, how it affects market-making and obviously there the clients are going to be concerned. Do you have good market-making? There are all these rules around it. We're accommodating those, reporting client demand, aged inventory, different ways of reporting volatility and trading and now you have capital liquidity. So all the trading is to try to make it safer, but also so people can make markets and we hope at the end of the day that will happen. If there needs to be adjustments, it's going to be because you clients are going to say this isn't working for us. The only other thing I'll mention about liquidity, spreads are the same in credit, but the size you can trade in is much smaller, which to me is an early indicator if something goes wrong you're going to have a gap out in spreads quicker and wider than you might have before. But at the end of the day, we hope to be able to be a good market-maker, earn a fair return for shareholders and obviously we got to -- we have to apply Volcker and all the other regulations to it.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I think the thing to think about when you look at the comp to revenue ratio just for the purposes of clarity is that if you look at the fourth quarter of last year, excluding DVA and FVA, it was about closer to 26%, so closer to in line year-over-year. And that's evident when you look at the full-year ratio last year of 31% to 30%. So we're at the low end of our range at 30% but within the range relative to the performance and there was a big negative impact in the CIB on a revenue basis last year with FVA/DVA.
JAMIE DIMON: And I should say that we've always allocated capital to the investment bank and we've had SVA-adjusted returns and stuff like that. So as you allocate more capital, all things being equal, that number comes down a little bit. So we've been disciplined in trying to do that properly.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think if you look at the 2015 dynamic, there's going to be three principal things. 2014 was a year of larger deals. 2015 has still got a good pipeline, so we're expecting to have a reasonably strong at least start to the year and probably a strong year and it's very driven in the fourth quarter and likely to continue to be so by sort of M&A-related financings. So the downside we talked about is just less maturities to be refinanced, but nevertheless some, but we're going to continue to have support from the M&A space, which looks set to be fairly strong in 2015. So you've got some puts and takes, but what we think is going to be a solid to good year in 2015, maybe not a record, but certainly a good year.
JAMIE DIMON: And so JPMorgan maintained a number one share in global investment grade, number one share in global high yield, number one share in loan syndication, which we hope to maintain next year too and those are very powerful positions to have.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just, first of all, I think to put it into context, I think that the RWA growth was $12 billion, so nevertheless a growth, but not a huge number. A chunk of it was regular weight CDA, which, yes, in part has got to do with just normal market dynamics right now as spreads wider and volatility higher, but a chunk of it is unrelated to that. As we look forward to the end of next year at 1.5, and which just to be clear I think I said 1.5 or maybe slightly higher, but nevertheless in the law of big numbers, the same trajectory. It's more at risk from just the timing of our ability to execute on granular segmented models, model approvals internally and with regulators than necessarily any sort of market dynamic, notwithstanding that that will factor in. So I would say the bigger risks to achieving that are less than the market pricing impacts on CDA, but more the ability for us to get the right timing of those model benefits.
JAMIE DIMON: And I think like two-thirds are models and one-third is runoff of stuff we know is going to happen. And the other thing, as Marianne mentioned, the advanced where we're 10.1%, the standardized were 10.5% and yes, the advanced will change -- if spreads gap out, advanced will go up, but standardized won't. And eventually we think standardized is going to become the binding constraint, not advanced.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously, we talked about the card portfolio exits driving some revenue decline, also some elevated credit charge-offs. We've been experiencing, and I think we've guided to the low end of our 12.5% revenue rate range. We guided to that last quarter or the quarter before and at 12.2%, we're in that range and what we're experiencing is spread compression is largely offsetting the strong interchange and other fee growth from the volume, but when you acquire new customers and you pay the premium to acquire new customers that gets amortized through your results in the first year. So in years when you're net acquiring new customers, you will have a small net drag on your fees and on your revenue rate resulting from amortizing those premiums for the benefit of those strong relationships and the increased outstandings and spend sales volume you get in future years. So we've been on a journey for the last two years and we continue to be on it where there is some impact associated from the fact that we are net acquiring new customers, each of which we believe returns hurdle for us or more than hurdle for us, so is accretive over a period.
JAMIE DIMON: I wouldn't spend too much time trying to build this into your models if I were you, but it is quite clear that when you add $800 a year to the consumer's cash flow statement that consumers on average spend most of that and I think you're seeing it in spend and you're seeing it in car sales and you're seeing it in retail spend, you're seeing it -- and it's also quite clear it helps consumers, it helps their credit broadly. We're not going out and saying that we're going to reduce credit costs and auto, card and a bunch of stuff by 10 or 15 basis points, but I'm just saying you know it's going to be there. Just like you know it was there on the flipside where people spent a lot of time talking about how much gas prices are hurting consumers and why sales are down at Walmart and Family Dollar Store, etc. This is just the flipside of that.
MARIANNE LAKE: And if you just looked at the consumer spending statistics, if you look at fourth-quarter annualized up 4.7% is the best consumer spend data since 2003. So it's already taking effect in consumer spend and disposable income is -- as you say, we're already expecting new car sales to grow next year, but all of this is going to support the continued strong trends we've seen in consumer.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you're right; we're close to lapping the acquisition cost dynamic not this quarter, but in the near future, but what you are going to continue to see is that we have a portfolio that is in runoff and as those loans run off, they were loans that were higher APR, higher rate loans than the ones that we're originating right now and as a result, you're going to continue to see some spread compression in 2015 again to which you're going to see strong interchange. So I would say, yes, ultimately and in the fullness of time, you're going to start to see the interchange growth outpace the spread compression, but for a period of time, they are going to be somewhat of a wash.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So overall, the way to think about it is it's not ultimately going to be necessarily zero, but when you think about it in the context of the capital and the relative returns, it was not accretive to our returns, and so we have the differential between 500 and 300. For the full year, it's still not zero. There is a slight lag. Clearly there's a slight lag taking out the expenses, but there's still an overall small net income impact, but for overall mutual to positive benefit on the return.
MARIANNE LAKE: And regardless of that, remember that our rationale for business simplification included a bunch of different reasons. It included activities that weren't core to our core clients' activities that were outsized in terms of operational or other risks, as well as those that weren't returning hurdles. So there are other reasons to simplify your business and they will have other ancillary benefits.
MARIANNE LAKE: So no specific one-time items in the equity derivative performance. The uptick in VAR has to do generally speaking with higher levels of volatility than it does with anything in terms of risk direction.
JAMIE DIMON: Equity derivatives are largely Japan and Europe and Asia.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: The increase.
MARIANNE LAKE: Largely Asia, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: It's an example where volatility did actually help.
MARIANNE LAKE: If you look at equities in total, particularly in the prime space, there was a small one-time item, but not in the derivatives space.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's not a significant increase in VAR, but, yes, you see increase in CPG VAR on spread widening and volatility, increase in equities. Just year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we've seen an increase in volatility.
MARIANNE LAKE: This quarter more than any quarter it's really honestly to early to make any comments of any note regarding trading performance, particularly given that the holiday fell midweek. So the reality of the situation is thematically nothing has changed from the end of the fourth quarter, but there's no big new news in the first few days of trading.
JAMIE DIMON: It was year-end cleanup; it had nothing to do with business simplification.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I think if you look at our revenues excluding FVA/DVA year-over-year, they are down reasonably in line with comp.
JAMIE DIMON: I think they are two different issues. One is the correspondent business properly done is fine and obviously we do look at their credit underwriting because we've had a backup over the last 5 or 10 years. Correspondents are no longer in business and if they did a bad job, we had to pay for that. So you want to be very careful and do business with the proper kind of people. We have reduced our share of FHA loans just because the ongoing -- two reasons. One is the ongoing liability in the production side where the insurance was worthless over time and the second is just the cost of servicing FHA loans when they go into default and they have a much higher chance of going into default than not. So those are two reasons to do less. And maybe that will change over time, but we're still in the same place in that.
MARIANNE LAKE: And just on the share gains, they are in jumbo and conventional conforming loans, not in the government space. So yes, we are competing aggressively on price, but with the right capital allocation and with the right hurdle and these are loans that are very high quality that we are willing to put on our balance sheet done with correspondents that we have confidence in the financial status of.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the GSE -- you could always get loans up to 97% in the government space, you could get it in the agency space with mortgage insurance. We've seen some movement from the FHA on [GCs] and mortgage insurance premiums, all of which I think is intended to try and help credit availability, which we would generally support. It doesn't change our strategy, however, which is that we are much more focused on originating in the very high quality jumbo and conventional conforming space. But, yes, properly underwritten we will do agency loans in the programs that they have available.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, look, we have, over the last, I think, two years and a quarter, two plus years or so, we've seen an inflow of cash of between $300 billion and $400 billion on our balance sheet. So our balance sheet size has grown slightly over the course of the last several quarters in the last year, but the vast majority of the growth is driven by incremental cash and there's two principal reasons for that. One is as we have been looking to become compliant with our own and with US rules on liquidity, which we are compliant with at this point and have been for a while, that the other is also that we've been receiving increased nonoperational cash predominantly from wholesale clients. And so to the degree that that cash is accretive from an NII perspective and that we aren't balance sheet or leverage constrained and it's a key part of the relationship with that client, that may not be a bad thing. But to the degree that it's not a key part of the relationship, we're going to be disciplined about trying to manage that balance. So I would say underlying that, we would expect our balance sheet to not be growing certainly not significantly, but cash can be the volatile factor.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we saw loan growth year-over-year 8% core, 3% reported. We feel pretty good about the demand for loans across our businesses, particularly those that have been performing strongly now consistently like business banking, like prime mortgage on the portfolio, commercial real estate, even auto and we continue to be optimistic about C&I and even Card. So yes, we would expect to see robust loan growth into next year hopefully on the back of a continued improvement in the economy.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'll give you a (inaudible) one for you. On the back of robust loan demand and rising rates in the second half of the year, which is our current central case, then we would expect NII to be up in the second half of the year, flattish in the first half of the year. Obviously if those two things don't play out then that wouldn't be the case. I'll let you draw your own conclusions on the rest of it.
JAMIE DIMON: You're using the implied yield curve effectively, so if that changes then obviously that will affect the second half of the year.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, unscrambling it would be extraordinarily complex and it would be extraordinarily complex in debt, in systems, in technology, in people and where certain things go and the businesses would start competing with each other right away, which I think is perfectly reasonable if they were all separate standalone. So look, we're very conscious of the narrative, which has become out there about this, but it is far more complex than that. The right way to look at it is we have these great franchises, we have a lot of time to manage through this and that is our objective, not unscrambling the egg. We're going to manage through it and we can manage almost every single part of it over -- think of over a long period, like five or seven years. Don't think of over six months or a year. There's nothing we couldn't set a limit, drive down, sell, manage and that would probably be far easier than the alternative. Even if it led to lower growth, it wouldn't necessarily lead to lower returns. So just keep in mind that obviously we're going to do the right thing at the end of the day for the shareholder. It might be lower growth and better returns and managing through that and not doing certain things at all. Marianne mentioned for example the amount of deposits we take in. Well, it might be that we limit and restrict the amount of deposits we take in at quarter-end. We do it to accommodate clients, but all those nonoperational deposits go directly into the Federal Reserve. So that's what Marianne said. We do it and maybe make some spread. If you can get 25 basis points there and you maybe are paying the client something. There are some clients which aren't charged to take their quarter-end. They don't do enough business with us and we don't want their quarter-end balances. So we have a lot of levers, we have a lot of time and we are going to do it very intelligently over time. We're not going to damage this franchise just because of a current narrative. And the other thing I want to point out about the current narrative, which kind of surprises me that people don't mention, when you all talk about P/Es and sum of the parts, P/Es are temporary, P/Es change over time and the real question you should be asking is is the E going to be much higher or much lower under scenario A or B, not just what is the P/E going to be because I could give you a lot of scenarios where your E is going to be a hell of a lot lower and that dwarfs the effect of the P/E change and the P/Es themselves are temporary. JPMorgan is already earning its cost of capital and you're comparing it to P/Es to a lot of guys who aren't earning their cost of capital. Meaning people expect them to have dramatic growth in earnings, which they will and so it's -- you've really got to have a much more forward-looking view of what P/Es will be, what values will be, what earnings will be, what the franchise will be then just the sum of the parts breakup based on current P/Es and false comparisons. Some of the people out there that people compare it to they are not real comparisons. We are not in the same business with those people, but we are very shareholder-conscious. That's not to say we're not going to do the right thing for shareholders over time. We will; there are other ways to do it.
JAMIE DIMON: And the other thing which I think is important too is that we compete globally. Remember we have to be very conscious of who we're competing with and what they're going to do over time. And my guess is you're going to have some very large, very tough global competition over the next 20 years. They are not going away. They may have currently lower G-SIFI charges, but I'm not sure that's going to be true 10 years from now. Particularly the Chinese banks get bigger and bigger and some other global competitors decide they want to be in the global businesses.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, I would refer you to -- if you look at the 10-Q disclosure from last quarter, that will give you a sense for the things that are outstanding. We will obviously update and refresh it in the K, but we're not going to discuss specifically all of the remaining cases.
JAMIE DIMON: David, I think again I think the way people -- I know -- we know we cause problems with you all because we have this lumpy quarter-by-quarter type stuff. I wouldn't look at this as a quarter-by-quarter issue. If you owned 100% of this Company, the better way to look at it is it's going to cost us several billion dollars more somehow plus or minus another couple billion before we get to what I call a more normalized legalized basis. We disclose all that stuff in the 10-K. I think the RPL, if you ask me, is actually a fairly decent way to look at what those might be and we give you an RPL number, which is something that has not gone to the P&L, which is possible and we can't make something which is lumpy not lumpy and we can't make something which we wish we can bucket -- if we could, we would put all the reserves now and say we're done. We can't.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a number and the important part as a shareholder is I want to deal with that, acknowledge our mistakes, try to have a fortress controlled balance sheet, try to stop stepping in dog (expletive), which we do every now and then, but build a customer franchise is the important part. When you have a market cap of $230 billion, I want to make that worth $500 billion 10 years from now. There's several billion dollars that we're going to have to pay for legal, so we want to fix it and it's unfortunate we do this to you all, but it's unavoidable right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I can talk for JPMorgan very specifically that we are seeing the charge-off rate -remember, we have had charge-off rates for the auto business that have been relatively low for an extended period. Now we're seeing them revert back to something more normal and when we think about pricing the business and through the cycle, we contemplate a more normal level of charge-offs. So this isn't as surprising to us. Having said that, what we're also seeing in terms of just the broad competitive space is it's not irrationality necessarily, but longer duration, higher LTVs, more subprime originations. JPMorgan -- we are lower LTV than the industry and very concentrated on the near and super prime space. So there's part of that that we're just not participating in, but even for our own portfolio you're going to see some of those charge-off rates trend up to something a bit more normal, but that's how we think about the business through the cycle.
MARIANNE LAKE: I hate to say I'm confident about anything, but that's not our expectation.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a very good question because of what we all went through in the mortgage game where subprime was an early indicator for even prime. But when we look at credit card, we don't think it's an early indicator of credit card. We're going to be very conscious -- as Marianne said, auto did unbelievably well through the crisis, shockingly well we'd all say. So this is maybe a return to norm, but we're going to pay paying a lot of attention to it.
MARIANNE LAKE: And the loans that we're originating now, the very far, the right side of 700 FICO loans with LTVs lower than the industry lower than 100%.
JAMIE DIMON: I think, Nancy, views and facts are completely different, okay? This Company was a port in the storm in the real crisis in 2008 and 2009 and that was after we bought Bear Stearns and (inaudible). We had no issues whatsoever. We have a lot more capital now, we're more conservative now. We've got less credit exposure as a percent of the balance sheet. We've got less risk as a percent of the balance sheet. We've got more long-term debt, we've got more liquid assets. We've got more -- so it's even more true today. The fact is the Company is an extremely powerful thing. People, when they talk about risk, they are just talking about -- a lot of people, they look at size and it scares them. I completely understand that. But that isn't the determinant and I don't think we should be making shareholder decisions based upon views of people who don't necessarily really know. So if the regulators at the end of the day want JPMorgan to be split up then that's what will have to happen. We can't fight the federal government if that's their intent or maybe their intent is what it is. If you are going to carry more capital and you've got to modify your business model over time to carry capital, that one we think we can earn a superior return still versus other banks and carry the higher capital and modify our business model over time without taking drastic action. And remember, again, you've got to look forward in this. America has been the leader in global capital markets for the last 50 or 100 years. It's part of the reason the country is so strong. I look at it as a matter of public policy. I wouldn't want to see the next JPMorgan Chase be a Chinese company because someone has to be serving the global multinationals around the world and all the things that that means about knowledge and experience and research and capabilities. So I think that if you look ahead 10 years, you're going to have large global companies who compete and we may have to be slightly smaller than we might otherwise have been, but so be it. If we can do that and do a good return for shareholders, we should do that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I will tell you that to answer the question maybe just slightly differently but with the same basic point that we saw an increase in cash of about $45 billion or a little bit more that $45 billion in the quarter and that drove the vast majority of the 5 to 6 basis points decline in NIM.
MARIANNE LAKE: So what dictates what we have on deposits at the central bank -- for any deposit that we have that is excess operating or nonoperating that we don't think has any significant or any liquidity value to the Company, on the whole, those are all on deposit with central bank earning a very small amount of interest income. And there is some passed onto the client net-net, so something slightly accretive. So that's what's driving the amount of cash, so to the degree that we have more nonoperating cash that will drive that. We are compliant with LCR under the US rules with an appropriate but modest buffer right now and that's based upon what we think is a fairly forward-leaning point of view about what true operating deposits really are. So as we think about what the cash is in customers' accounts that they really require to operate their businesses and no more. So we think we've got a forward-leaning point of view on that. So I think the rules are for the US final. I think our ratio for US LCR right now will be favorable for a period of time and then if there are any changes, either to the US rules, which we don't have any line of sight on or if we are required to make changes or decide to make changes to our own internal liquidity framework, that could cause us to add to liquidity, but that's something that we'll inform you of as we go through time.
JAMIE DIMON: If you look at our balance sheet, forget all this rule stuff, we have almost $500 billion in central banks around the world. We have $300 billion plus of AA+ securities of very short duration. We have like $300 billion of repo and stock borrow, which is all secured in commodities by top credits with proper haircuts and stuff like that and with our capital base of equity capital of $200 billion, preferred stock of $30 billion, TLAC of debt of $150 billion plus, our loans are $700 billion, which has always been the riskiest part of our balance sheet. And receivable is like $70 billion and so this balance sheet of this Company is unbelievable.
MARIANNE LAKE: So for financial institutions and nonbanks -- for banks and nonbank financial institutions, yes, we passed on the overnight rate to our customers and it's basically on their operating cash flows. It is what it is. All we're doing is passing through the cost. It's operating cash for their business so there was --.
JAMIE DIMON: In euros.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, in euros, so there was no significant reaction at all. It's a market (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: It's very hard -- I mean you're not going to be taking deposits at a loss that are just very temporary to help our clients, so I think everyone understands that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, thanks very much.
JAMIE DIMON: All right. Thank you very much. Talk to you soon.",-0.1100000000000001,0.08999999999999908,1,0.08467996215950176,0.10175533972732262
10,Q4_2017,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CEO OF CONSUMER LENDING, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $4.2 billion, EPS of $1.07 and a return on tangible common equity of 8% on revenue of $25.5 billion. The impact of the U.S. tax reform is the one significant item we have this quarter. We reported a $2.4 billion reduction to our fourth quarter net income. Excluding this, our performance would have been $6.7 billion of net income, EPS of $1.76 per share with an ROTCE of 13%. Similar to the last few quarters, our underlying results were quite strong in the fourth quarter, and highlights included average core loan growth of 6% year-on-year, bringing us to 8% for the full year; and credit performance continued to be very strong; a good holiday season fueled double-digit growth in Card sales and merchant volumes, each up 13%; our client investment assets were up 17%; we maintained our #1 rank in global IBCs and we grew share; and we had record net income and revenue in the Commercial Bank and record revenue and AUM in Asset & Wealth Management. Before I go into our results, let's spend time on tax reform on Page 2. The $2.4 billion impact of tax reform was largely driven by a deemed repatriation of our unremitted overseas earnings as well as an adjustment to the value of our tax-oriented investments, including affordable housing and energy. These were partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability. The impact is primarily in Corporate, but as you can see, there was some impact to each of the CIB and the Commercial Bank. The capital impact is $1.2 billion higher at $3.6 billion or about 25 basis points of CET1. And our effective tax rate will be approximately 19% this year and 20% over the near term, think through 2020, after which, it should start to gradually increase as certain business credits are phased out over time. While there is now an enacted bill, and with that, there's more clarity, there are still a number of open implementations as well as accounting questions that will require clarification. And as such, our estimated impact may be refined in future quarters. That said, I know there are a number of important questions which I'll try and get you clarity on. First, with respect to the deemed repatriations, the operative word for us is deemed. In many ways, you can think of our unremitted overseas earnings as the equivalent of bricks and mortar being required in order to meet local jurisdictional capital and liquidity requirements. So we do not expect to actually remit anything significant. Second, although the reduction in the corporate tax rate was 14%, you can see that the reduction in our effective tax rate is only about 10%, given the impact of the geographic mix of our taxable income, the disallowance of FDIC fees and smaller benefits associated with tax-exempt income and other deductions as a result of the lower absolute rate. Moving on to the BEAT tax. This is an area where there do remain open questions. However, at this point, we do not expect to have a BEAT liability. But if we're wrong, we would not expect it to be material. Next, the question of whether the benefit will be competed away and, if so, over what time line. Pricing strategy will differ across products. It is true that we operate in competitive and transparent markets, and this means that, ultimately, you could expect some of the benefit for the industry will be passed through to our customers over time. Competition is one key driver, but there are other factors, such as scale, expertise, the breadth of your products and services and the investments that you're making in customer experience, and these matter a lot. And for certain of our businesses, pricing is not necessarily directly or immediately driven by fluctuations in the cost of capital, think flow markets. And remember, we didn't get to price up the changes in market structure and capital and liquidity over the last several years. So it will be nuanced, it will be different across products, and time is a very important dimension. Any competitive dynamics will play out over time. We are in the process of putting together a cohesive and comprehensive set of long-term and sustainable actions for our employees, for customers and communities in part in response to tax reform. Some of our plans may involve subsidies for lower-income borrowers and support for small businesses. And for these customers and for some others, they may feel a benefit sooner. With respect to our capital plan, there are no immediate changes to note. This won't change our overall strategy, and remember, the first half of 2018 is governed by last year's CCAR. Finally, on the potential impact to our businesses, the modernization of the U.S. tax code is a significant step forward for the country and a big win for the economy. And we include an estimated 20 to 30 basis points of growth in the U.S. this year and next. However, clients are still digesting the tax bill, and much like this rate cycle, we haven't seen this movie before. We'll have to watch it play out. There will be pluses and minuses by clients and pluses and minuses across the products. So overall, stepping back, tax reform is a positive. And for our clients, there's more certainty, more clarity, and that should give them confidence to act. Moving now to Page 3, let's get into some details on the fourth quarter results. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion or 5% year-on-year as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in Markets. Loan interest revenue was down modestly as growth in Auto as well as Asset & Wealth Management partially made up for lower Markets performance. Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 9% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth, including Auto lease depreciation. In the fourth quarter, we took an impairment charge of a little over $100 million related to certain leased asset in the Commercial Bank. And we increased our contribution to the foundation, adding $200 million this quarter. Credit costs of $1.3 billion were up about $450 million year-on-year. Charge-offs were flat, with an increase in Card being offset by continued decreases across other portfolios. And although net reserve builds this quarter were modest, we saw releases in the fourth quarter of last year of approximately $400 million. Shifting to the full year on Page 4. We reported net income for the year of $24.4 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 12% and EPS of $6.31. Adjusting for the 2 front-page significant items that we had this year, being tax reform this quarter and the benefit of the WaMu settlement in the second quarter, our net income would've been another record of $26.5 billion with an ROTCE of 13% and EPS of $6.87. Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year, which feels good, $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing but pressured by lower Market NII. Noninterest revenue was up $400 million with higher Auto lease income as well as higher fees across the Investment Bank; Asset, Wealth Management; and Consumer, adding $2.6 billion to revenues and more than compensating for headwinds in Home Lending on a smaller market, investments in Card and lower Markets. We ended the year with adjusted expense of $58.5 billion, but as you can see, we made a total contribution to our foundation this year of $350 million in part in anticipation of tax reform. This brings our adjusted overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. Credit cost for the year were $5.3 billion, down 1% as the environment remains benign. Moving on to Page 5, balance sheet and capital. We ended the year with CET1 of 12.1%, down almost 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, about 25 basis points of which related to tax adjustments, and the remainder, loan growth. All the other ratios as well as tangible book value per share also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform. Moving on to Page 6 on Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 13%; and Business Banking, Card and Auto loans and leases were each up 6%. Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industry-wide slowdown, given rising rates. Card sales and merchant processing volumes were each up 13%, driven by continued strength from Card new products as well as ongoing momentum in Merchant Services. In December, we completed the acquisition of WePay, which marks a big step for us into the integrated payment space, allowing us to efficiently provide software-enabled payments to small business clients. And we also completed the renegotiation with Marriott for our co-branded cards, which will make us the largest issuer of the largest co-branded hotel program in the world. For all intents and purposes, we've now finished the renewals of our co-branded card deals. Revenue of $12.1 billion was up 10% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was down 15% on lower net servicing revenue driven by MSR as well as loan spread compression. Our originations were down 16% and the market's down an estimated 25%. And we gained share, a trend we expect to continue, given our investments. And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 11% year-on-year on higher Auto lease income, growth in Card loan balances and margins, and lower net acquisition costs. For the full year, Card revenue rate was 10.6%, in line with our guidance, and we still expect to reach 11.25% in the first half of this year. Expense of $6.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth. The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of '17. Finally, on credit. Card charge-offs came in line with guidance for the year at 2.95%. The increase in Card charge-offs was predominantly offset by preceding credit performance across other portfolios. In terms of credit reserves, the net $15 million build this quarter was driven by a $200 million build in Card on growth, offset by releases in Home Lending of $150 million and Auto of $35 million. And as I noted last quarter, Auto trends have stabilized and the industry feels to be on solid footing. Now turning to Page 7 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $7.5 billion and an ROE of 12%. But revenue was impacted by 2 noteworthy items this quarter, and both of them had an impact in Markets, so I'll start with Markets. Total Markets revenue was $3.4 billion, down 26% year-on-year. However, Fixed Income Markets included the net impact of tax reform on our tax-oriented investments, which was approximately $260 million, accounting for 6% of the year-on-year Markets decline. Additionally, Equity Markets included a notable loss of $143 million on a single margin loan. This accounted for 3% of the year-on-year decline. It's worth noting that the loss appears here in Markets as we elected fair value option on this loan. However, when you do industry comparisons, be aware that others involved in this facility may not have made that same election and may have all of their losses in credit. So in addition, although not in Markets revenues, $130 million of credit cost this quarter was driven by a reserve build related to that same name. So adjusting for those items, our Markets revenue would have been down 17% year-on-year, which is much closer to the experience up to the beginning of December, when we last spoke publicly. Fixed income revenue was down 27% adjusted, principally driven by a tough prior year comparison and low volatility and tight credit spreads which have continued into this quarter. Equities revenue was up 12% adjusted against the record fourth quarter of '16. And similar to the past few quarters, the driver of the increase was continued tailwinds from investments in cash, prime and corporate derivatives. Moving on to banking. We had a record year for total fees and for debt underwriting fees. We maintained our #1 rank in global IBCs while growing share, and we also ranked #1 in North America and EMEA. This quarter, IB revenue was $1.6 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by broad strength across capital markets. Advisory fees were up 2% as we saw good momentum with some large deals closing. We ranked #2 for the year in wallet, gaining share. And we completed more deals than any other bank. Equity underwriting fees were up 14% with indices up across every region and several at or near all-time highs. We maintained leadership positions in wallet and volume across every product globally this year. And while we ended up #2 in wallet, the distance to #1 was only a few basis points. And debt underwriting fees were up 12% as the market remained receptive to new issuance across high-grade and leveraged finance and refinancing activity was strong. We maintained our #1 rank. We gained share, and this year, booked [around] the most number of deals in the firm's history. The overall pipeline remains healthy and at levels similar to last year. Our balance sheets are strong and market conditions favorable. Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 13%. In addition to higher rates, we continued to see organic growth within the business as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform. Securities Services revenues of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances with average deposits up 12% year-on-year and higher asset-based fees on record AUC, given higher market levels globally. Finally, expense of $4.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by the relative timing of compensation accruals. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%; for the year, 28%, broadly in line with prior year. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 8. It was another outstanding quarter for the Commercial Bank with record net income of $957 million, record revenue of $2.4 billion and an ROE of 18%. And for the year, net income and revenue were also records. The business is firing on all cylinders and delivered an ROE of 17%. For the quarter, revenue included a benefit of a little over $100 million associated with tax reform and in our Community Development Banking business. Even without this benefit, revenue would still be a record, up 14% year-on-year, on higher NII from higher rates as well as deposit and loan growth across businesses. IB revenue of $587 million was down 3% year-on-year but still a strong performance. For the full year, we saw record IB revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, with particular strength in middle market, which was up over 50%, compensating for a smaller number of large deals. The pipeline and momentum into the first quarter feels good. Expense of $912 million included an impairment charge, also, of a little over $100 million on certain leased equipment, which we expect to sell in the first half of this year. Excluding this, we saw expense growth of 9% as we executed on our technology and product investments. And this year, we added net 120 new bankers in the business and entered 6 new markets, giving us a presence in all top 50 MSAs. Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year, 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 6% year-on-year, driven by continued strength in expansion markets and specialized industries. While sequential growth was up a more modest 1%, we're seeing decent deal flow, and pipelines are holding steady. Client sentiment continues to be strong, supported by corporate tax reform. CRE saw growth of 9% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, in line with the industry. Multifamily lending continued to see tightened pricing on elevated competition. We remain appropriately focused on client selection, given where we are in the cycle and with particular caution around construction lending. Finally, credit remains among the best we've seen. This quarter, we saw a benefit of $62 million, largely driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas portfolio. And net charge-offs were 4 basis points. Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset, Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $654 million with a pretax margin of 30% and an ROE of 28%. Revenue was a record $3.4 billion this quarter, driven by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposits and loans. For the full year, net income and revenue were records with a pretax margin of 28% and an ROE of 25%. Expense for the quarter of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by a combination of higher compensation as well as a gross up for external fees, which is offset in revenue. For the quarter, we saw long-term net inflows of $30 billion with positive flows across all asset classes on continued strong long-term performance. For the full year, we had long-term net inflows of $68 billion, driven predominantly by fixed income, multiasset and alternatives. Record AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 15% and 14%, respectively, year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 10% year-on-year, down 2% sequentially, reflecting continued migration into investment-related assets, the vast majority of which we are retaining. And new client flows remain healthy. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 11% year-on-year; including mortgage, up 14%. Moving to Page 10 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $2.3 billion, which includes $2.7 billion of the tax reform adjustment. Treasury & CIO's results improved year-on-year primarily due to the benefit of higher rates. So finally turning to Page 11 and the outlook. Before I get to specifics, remember, we do have Investor Day coming up in February, so we will be giving you a lot more guidance there. That leaves me with 2 structural things to talk about, the first, staying on the theme of tax reform. And lower corporate tax rate in 2018 will have the effect of reducing the tax equivalent adjustment or gross ups in our managed revenues. On a run rate basis, that reduction for the full year will be about $1.2 billion, and more than half of that is in the NII. Secondly, effective January 1, 2018, a new revenue recognition accounting rule came into effect, which requires certain expenses to be grossed up that were previously recognized as contra expense -- contra revenue. We estimate, for the full year, the impact will increase both revenues and expenses for the firm by another $1.2 billion, the vast majority of which will be in Asset, Wealth Management with a small amount in the CIB. So for guidance, expect the first quarter NII will be down modestly quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a combination of the lower gross ups I mentioned as well as normal day count which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth. And we estimate the first quarter effective tax rate will be about 17%, reflecting seasonality of stock comp adjustments. So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets; higher interest rates; good economic data globally; decent client activity; high levels of confidence; and, obviously, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Against that backdrop, our underlying financial performance in the fourth quarter and 2017 was strong, benefiting from diversification and scale and consistently delivering for our customers and communities, gaining share across our businesses. Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been clear records, driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity. We're excited about the landscape and the opportunities for our clients in 2018. We will be there for them, and the company is poised to continue to perform. With that, operator, I will take questions. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: So I mean, you are right. That's probably more of an Investor Day discussion. But what I would tell you is that when we have given that as our sort of medium-term guidance, in our simulation, we kind of imagined an environment that was more normalized in lots of ways. So we anticipated higher -- more normal interest rates. We anticipated the continuation of somewhat benign credit. And we anticipated continuing to invest in the businesses. And you've seen us do it in 2017. And we would expect to do it and more in 2019 -- '18. So certainly, there could be years when we would be below it, and there have been years when we were above it, but I think it's still a decent place for us to be aiming for in the near term.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I know that everybody is eagerly awaiting there to be direct and noticeable impacts of tax reform, but we're only a couple of weeks into the year. And so our expectation, as I said before, just really stepping back, is that it will boost growth in the economy. People have different points of view. Our research team is saying by up to 30 basis points in each of the next 2 years. But know it could be better than that. We do know that there will be puts and takes across our businesses, but in general, we would expect that the sort of certainty that people have been waiting for, coupled with the confidence that we know they've had, and the need for people to try and deliver growth to their shareholders, should mean that things that they were going to do become more compelling and they might be willing to do more. So I think you'll see the capital market space potentially react more quickly, and I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never. So we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of it play out. But sentiment is strong. Cash positions will be improved. Profitability will be higher. Things that were rich before will be more fairly valued now. And so I think it should be all very constructive. And certainly, we would take the upside, and we support our clients.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's a good model with just one clarification. So yes, a little more than half of the gross-up adjustment is NII. Yes, it is broadly linear for the sake of argument. So $150 million is not a bad estimate. It's actually more like $160 million, but pretty close. The day count is actually not worth $300 million. It's worth a little bit less than $200 million. So you've got a sort of headwind, for want of a better word, of call it $300 million and change. And then we would have had a combination of the impact of the December hike, which obviously, each hike, the impact is less, some growth and other puts and takes. So call it $350 million of a headwind offsetting growth and the rate hike.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say about deposit betas, at this point, you really do have to think about it in a sort of bifurcated way. So firstly, I would say that the cumulative beta we've experienced, and I wouldn't say we've seen it slow down, but it's remained disciplined generally. What we've seen so far in the rate cycle is very similar to what we saw in previous rate cycles. So it's not like we learned stunning new news from which we can extrapolate and make changes to our expectations. So we have no real change in the long-term expectations to reprice. And it really is at this point bifurcated. So retail, checking and core savings, there've been little to no movement in the industry. But again, given the absolute level of rates, that would be in line with our expectations. And on the wholesale space, we're definitely in reprice territory. It is accelerating with every hike, and it's different across the spectrum. So obviously, more significant in the sort of TS, Securities Services space. So -- but my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates is that, on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018. But ultimately, we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that time line looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50%, but we'll have to see.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, I'll give you a framework to think about it, if it's helpful. And you can certainly ask a follow-up question. But you are very familiar with the way that we think about sort of our strategy over time and our investment strategy in particular. And investing in our businesses for growth and profitability has always been first and foremost in our minds. And to be honest, we've talked to you before about the fact that we don't constrain ourselves because we have budgetary targets on those activities if we think we can execute well and we see great opportunity. So expect that the first thing that we would do is to continue to lean into the investment opportunities we have writ large. So that's bankers. That's offices. That's global expansion to the degree that that's on the cards. It's digital capabilities, [copayments] capabilities. It's across all of our businesses. And we've been working even before tax reform on identifying where those opportunities are, and we want to lean into that. We will also -- and Jamie said it earlier, we are really pleased that there are some immediate responses for employee benefits. And we will be doing that plus more across our stakeholder constituents. And there will be more to come on that over the next few weeks. And we want to focus on that being, like, comprehensive and sustainable. So we're really trying to be thoughtful about the things that will matter to our employees and to our customers. And then to the degree that we end up still with earnings that were otherwise above plan, then our normal capital strategy comes into play. We've been clear. We think that we are adequately capitalized, that we should expect to have the capital ratio move down slowly over time. And our strategy on potentially continuing to see dividend increases and having repurchase programs that allow us to achieve our target ratio, that hasn't changed. It just might be a bigger dollar number.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I'll just deal with the Card revenue rate real quick because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter, that given the Sapphire Reserve product and given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is an annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you, you would expect to see the revenue rate go down. It was contemplated, and which is why our full year revenue rate of 10.6% was in line with our guidance. And as we lap the acquisition costs and reward costs associated with acquiring all of those Sapphire Reserve customers, and for that matter, our other new products, we're going to see that revenue rate get to the 11.25%, if not in the first quarter, in the first half of next year and stabilize out at or above that level.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So again, there are -- it's nuanced, so what I expect though, the first question generally that we're getting is the impact on the housing market given certain specific changes in the tax code. I would say that overall, net-net, we would expect there to be not a significant impact on the housing market and demand nationally, although it could differ by state. So we feel like that's going to hold up nicely. And then you're right. Whether you're talking about consumers or whether you're talking about small businesses, think about the small business environment, this was quite positive for them, so they're going to see higher profitability, higher free cash flow, and to all intents and purposes, the equivalent of an upgrade. So we would be hopeful that, much like the commercial space, that could be the catalyst to see them spend money and hire. And we'll be focusing on that as we think about programs to help. So I think in general, it's going to mean that the already very good credit trends we're seeing will be good for longer.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sure. So Glenn, I want to -- because I feel like in 2017, we spent so much time talking about year-over-year declines in comparable periods, it's helpful to, I think, step back and remember the full performance for 2017 for fixed income and for equities and for markets in total. And so acknowledging that the first quarter was quite strong, if you look at the last 3 quarters, we were talking about reasonably quiet environment, low volatility, historically tight spreads. And yet, those businesses individually and together delivered meaningfully above the cost of capital for us. So maybe not at the sort of outperformance level of 2016 but really good performance. So discipline, scale, optionality, those are the ways we think about fixed income business. And so although I don't -- I'm not going to -- I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you when there will be a catalyst for change. Fixed income is a little on the countercyclical side. There will be change. And we're positioned to continue to be able to grow with our clients. So like our businesses are doing well. And can't tell you when things will become more volatile. And obviously, that's always an emotional discussion. But it will happen. And when it does, we'll be there to serve our clients and to [be there for] them.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean, this will garner attention because of the sort of sudden and significant decline. But -- and it is by far and away the largest loss in that business that we've seen since the crisis. And know it will happen from time to time, maybe not this significantly or this suddenly. And remember that because we've got that in fair value, we brought that down, down. So that's not a reserve, that's a mark to market on a publicly traded equity at this point that is significantly down. And so I would say while we're obviously disappointed with the outcome, it's the business we're in. It's a large and diversified business, that even after this loss, it's still very profitable. So it's noteworthy because of its size, its rapidity and it's significant. But it's a profitable business. And without sort of laboring the point, obviously, we go through talking about the potential for there to be [rifles] and sudden-risk situations. And I've talked about that in our governance processes. And sometime, that will happen.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, I'm not going to give you, like, quantification, but you're not meaningfully wrong about the sort of assessment you made, which it is a big, significant positive and much of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond. And time is an important part to how this plays out. So we want to do really constructive, thoughtful things for all of our constituents, but it won't be the significant portion of that.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I do want to just -- like, there are 2 other things, just after what Jamie said, which is if some of this is competed away over time and gets to lower cost of credit and lower cost of borrowing and improved pricing to our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop. Similarly, if at the end of the day, it results in some higher dividends or repurchases, that also recycles back into the economy. So like, we're very optimistic for the performance of this company, which is extraordinarily client-centric. So anything that's good for the economy and our clients will continue to drive long-term profitability for the company. That would be number one. And number two, not to be defensive, but you guys will appreciate this more than anyone almost, is you can do your own math. But if you add up the cost of controlled market structure reform, capital and liquidity, much of which we're entirely supportive of. But if you add up the impact that had on our returns over the last 5 to 10 years, I mean it, in many ways, dwarfs this. So there will be an element of this that goes back into making sure that the banking system is probably covering the cost of equity, and it should.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I would say if you look across the consumer spectrum, x Card, the credit performance is, like, really, really good and should continue to be really good in 2018. So 2018 feels like very strong credit performance in Consumer. In Card, we said at Investor Day that we would expect to continue to see charge-off rates go up and we're growing loans. So a combination of those things will mean we'll have higher charge-offs and some reserve builds. I will tell you that we're not seeing anything that isn't in line with our expectation. So this is not normalization deterioration. This is seasoning and maturation of the newer vintages and growth. And so if I sort of sent you back to what we talked about earlier in the year, it's probably closer to 3.25% but in line with our expectations. So we're expecting very much more of the same in the consumer space. And in the wholesale space, credit is really, really good. And some of the places where we had been watching for there to potentially be stress, fundamentals are improved. And we continue to obviously watch retail and to be cautious, given where we are on certain parts of real estate banking. But we're not seeing any fragility right now in our outlook.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we actually had been on a pretty significant strategic drive to make sure that we had a deeply, deeply engaged customer base. If you go back precrisis and look at the industry, there was also a balance [focus] and less engaged customers. So we worked really hard over the course of the last many years to drive engagement, which is why you can see that we have a larger share of spend than we do of outstandings, but we've grown both. So we are getting balances from new customers. We are working on making sure that the right customers are revolving. And we're making progress. So year-on-year, we've gained share in both, and we'll continue to focus on revolve.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, obviously, the impact is differently situated for the foreign banking set. And I know that there -- as Jamie said, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of implementation and finalization of the actual code itself. So I don't want to guess on how all that will play out. I certainly don't want to guess about the second-order impact of potential consolidation.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. That was a lot. So if you assume that the 2018 structure is much like 2017 with a nice, healthy caveat that DTAs, DTLs and the impact of them can be volatile based on the scenario, so with that caveat, I would tell you that not carrying back NOLs has a very particular interplay with foreign tax credits, which means it's not really going to affect us in a meaningful way. There are 2 things that would change, but they also offset. So the 2 things that would change is your absolute level of losses would be higher as the tax rate is lower, but -- so that would be a negative. But against that, your NOL carryforward would be lower and that's the capital to deduct. So in the law of very big numbers would help warnings, plus or minus, at our low point, we think not a significant impact. And then if you were to take a look at our starting point capital, I'd just make 2 comments. The first is, obviously, given all of the conversations we've just had, there is also the strong possibility that we will have higher earnings in the first half of the year and be able to accrete back portions, if not all of that, capital. And secondly, for what it's worth, our actual spot capital ratios were higher than our CCAR outlook was. So both from a starting point and tax effective, I feel okay, but that's a really complicated question, and we need to, like, really work through it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean we -- for what it's worth, you should know our house view on interest rates is for there to be 4 hikes next year. The Fed dot's at 3, the market has 2. I would say tax reform and a stronger growth outlook will solidify the path of rate hikes. And so we've been factoring that into our balance sheet positioning anyway. So I would not expect there to be a material change in our strategy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Our capital plan approval is on a nominal dollar basis.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say -- I mean, in essence, time is our friend. So if you go back and look at -and obviously, nothing is exactly like this. But if you go back and look at similar empirical evidence, it would say that any influences in terms of migration and flow of funds is pretty modest and pretty gradual. And so -- and if you think about something as first order as housing in high-tax states, well, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs and higher-income borrower are specifically less price-sensitive. So I think lots and lots of things come into play. I think the area that we're getting -- that we're thinking about a little more is what's the optimal financing structure for clients given changes across the capital market structure. But even in that sense, while you could say debt may be more expensive, it's still probably cheaper than equity, and equity may be more seen as fair value. But for JPMorgan, it's core to what we do. We do cross-border acquisition, acquisition financing, liability management, and [both] capital structure strategies, we do all of it. So even if the sort of mix and optimal structure change, I think we're pretty well situated. So it's early days to be able to say that we would have strategic changes. I think it's early days. And I would say that if that was to be the case, I would probably expect them to be quite marginal.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, I think that may be a fair observation, but I also think, to Jamie's earlier point, as much as we would like to imagine that all of this takes effect immediately, you would need to see the benefit of the environment in the income and spending and profitability and creditworthiness of people before you would be able to lean into the changes, necessarily, so maybe. But again, I think it's going to be something that will unfold.
MARIANNE LAKE: And pretty immediate.
MARIANNE LAKE: And pretty immediate.
MARIANNE LAKE: So probably it's an important thing because I think it's worth pointing out that there's been a lot of attention on a flatter yield curve, but you're right, it's driven by a higher [fund pen], which is a sort of good type of flattening, so to speak. And so that's what's been driving sort of NII growth for us. And we do expect that, that will, together with the Fed normalizing its balance sheet, ultimately end up with a higher long end of rate. So we're pretty optimistic about that. You're right that at some point, typically, you would see potentially higher rates depending on the speed and inflation and other factors that would be -- precede the potential for a credit cycle. I mean, I suspect this will be no different. That is not something that we see in our models or in our outlook over the near term. So hopefully, the monetary policy will be gradual, and as expected, and we'll continue to see the front-end raise and everything will be rational, and of course, there could be surprises, but at some point, yes, but not in the near future.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it differs. So it's shortened -- it...
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would start by saying that I think we showed at the Investor Day last year, and if we were to do something similar, maybe we will, it would look very similar today, which is if you go below our top line businesses to the businesses beneath that, so the vast majority of our businesses are more than covering that cost of equity by a fair margin today. So our investment strategy, it wouldn't be directly impacted by marginal changes in pricing and profitability up or down. We're going to continue to invest in everything that we can do well to improve the customer experience and grow the business. So I think we've been pretty consistent on that, not just today but over the course of the last several years. And then I think it is uncertain. And so I would just give you the obvious extremes, which is, if you have 4 different organizations competing for a single large structure transaction and the cost of capital and tax as a direct input to pricing, I'm sure it will feature in the discussion. And if you are talking about a very, very scale, very, very high-volume business with extraordinarily tight margins, it will probably have ultimately -- or at least in the very, very near term, less impact. But again, I actually think people will be quite disciplined how they think about this.
MARIANNE LAKE: The thing about the commercial bank is the absolute nexus of everything we do. It's delivering the whole company to our clients in a way that very few other people can do. And so we've been investing 100 banks of the year for a period of time, opening offices, adding capabilities, focusing on digital, improving the customer experience just like in the rest of our businesses. And so credit aside, where ultimately there will be a cycle and it will be fine, that business is really poised to do very well.
MARIANNE LAKE: Essentially everyone with a bank account.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So in Securities Services, we make money on NII. We make money on transactions. And We make money on AUC. And depending upon whether that's fixed income or equities or whether it's emerging markets for the U.S., will drive the extent of that. So it's not like you can take the overall revenue of Securities Services and link it to increases in assets under custody and draw a direct -- I mean, there's obviously a direct relationship, but it's not going to necessarily move in line. So I can tell you that looking at that decomposition of what time market levels and higher flows by region and looking at the portion of our revenues that's related to assets under custody that they were in line.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it is -- exactly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks, everyone. Happy New Year.",0.07000000000000006,-0.5079999999999983,0,0.10399523398004856,0.1256410114908699
11,Q4_2016,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. I'll take you through the presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. So starting on page 1, we had a strong end to the year, with record net income for a fourth quarter of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.71, and return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.3 billion, reflecting strong performance broadly across our businesses in a more constructive environment. You'll see on the page, a tax benefit of $475 million included in the result in the CIB, as we were able to utilize certain deferred tax assets. The quarter would still have been a record without that benefit. Highlights for the quarter included core loan growth of 12% with strength across businesses, continued double-digit consumer deposit growth, ending with deposits over $600 billion, and record card sales volume up 14% on continued strong momentum. In addition, markets revenue was the highest on record for a fourth quarter, up 24% year-on-year, and credit performance remains, strong with net reserve releases across both consumer and wholesale. Moving on to page 2, and some more detail about the fourth quarter, revenue of $24.3 billion was up $600 million, or 2% year-on-year, driven by net interest income on the back of continued strong loan growth, as well as the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue was flat year-on-year, with strength in markets offset by higher card new account acquisition costs. Adjusted expense of $13.6 billion was flat year-on-year, and this quarter's results included nearly $200 million of after-tax legal expense. Credit costs of $860 million in the quarter included a net reserve release of a little over $400 million across consumer and wholesale. Energy remained stable, and we saw modest releases in both oil and gas and metals and mining. Shifting to the full year on page 3, another full-year record net income of $24.7 billion, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $99 billion of revenue. And while net income was up 1%, our EPS of $6.19 was up more than that as we continued our disciplined capital return to shareholders. Revenue was up $2.5 billion, driven by NII, up $2.7 billion, on the back of loan growth and the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue remained flat year-on-year, reflecting strength in markets and funding card new account acquisitions, as well as lower asset management revenues. Adjusted expense for the year came in at $56 billion as expected, and our adjusted overhead ratio improved to 57%, as we continued to execute on and near the end of our strategic cost programs in CCB and CIB, as well as self-funding incremental investments in growth of nearly a billion dollars year-on-year. In addition, legal expense for the year was a modest positive. Credit costs for the year were $5.4 billion. Net charge-offs of $4.7 billion were in line with guidance, and included $270 million of charge-offs related to oil and gas and metals and mining. And we added [$670] million of net reserves, reflecting builds in card and energy, largely offset by releases in mortgage. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $15 billion, up $4 billion or 37%, including dividends of $1.88 a share, up 9%. Turning to page 4 and capital, we ended the year above 12% for both standardized and advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratios, in line with our expectations. Net capital generation for the quarter, while positive, included a 16 basis point impact of higher rates on investment securities AOCI. The advanced ratio improved primarily due to lower account party and market risk, whereas standardized was up by less, reflecting the impact of high quality loan growth. We've been disciplined managing our balance sheet, and our average balance sheet for the quarter was a little over $2.5 trillion, and $1.5 trillion of RWA. SLR was down slightly from the prior quarter at 6.5%, as our average balance sheet was higher this quarter, primarily driven by deposit. Moving on to page 5, and consumer and community banking, consumer and community banking generated $2.4 billion of net income, and an ROE of 17%. We grew deposits a record $60 billion year-over-year, up 11%, exceeding $600 billion. Core loans were up 14%, with mortgage up over 20%, but strength across all products, also up 11%, business banking up 9%, and card up 8%. We saw record card sales volume in the quarter, up 14% marking the strongest growth in a decade. Card new account originations were up 8%. They were up 20% for the full year, driven by strong demand for new products, and nearly 80% of those accounts were opened through digital channels. Merchant processing volumes were up 10% year-on-year, and surpassed the $1 trillion mark last year and our active mobile customer base continues to grow and was up 16%. Revenue of $11 billion was down modestly year-on-year, reflecting a reduction in card revenue. Recall that last year included a $160 million gain on the Square IPO. And in addition, strong momentum in card and auto was more than offset by the investments in our card new account acquisitions. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 4% on strong deposit growth, and mortgage revenue was relatively flat as higher production margins and volumes were offset by lower servicing revenue on lower balances. Expense of $6.3 billion was flat year-on-year, as growth in the business was largely offset by continued expense efficiencies and lower legal. Finally the credit trends in our portfolio remained favorable. We saw net reserve releases in the quarter driven by mortgage on lower delinquencies, as well as improving HPI, with releases of $275 million in the PCI portfolio and $150 million in NCI. On PCI specifically, actual losses have been lower than modeled output, and the release this quarter reflects that trend. We will continue to observe actuals, and recalibrate our models as necessary, which may result in future releases. These releases in mortgage were partially offset by a build in card of $150 million, and $50 million in business banking, both on the back of strong loan growth. Charge-offs increased year-over-year driven by card, as newer vintages continue to season in line with our expectations. And in auto, we are watching industry trends in sub prime and used car prices, but our heavily prime auto portfolio continues to perform well. Now turning to page 6, and the corporate investment bank., CIB delivered a very strong result, with net income of $3.4 billion, and an ROE of 20%. Adjusting for legal, tax and credit costs, the ROE was a strong 17% for the quarter. Revenue of $8.5 billion, up 20% year-on-year, was our best reported performance ever for a fourth quarter. As we look at the full year a moment on lead tables, in banking we ranked number one in global IB fees, and number one in North America and EMEA, and we were the only bank among the top 5 to grow share. In M&A, we continued to rank number two globally, and did more deals than anyone else last year. In ECM, we maintained our number one ranking, improved our share, and were number one in volume across all products, and in both North America and Europe. And in DCM, we ranked number one across high yield, high grade and loans. Back to the quarter, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year. Advisory fees were down 17% from a strong prior year quarter, and impacted by lower announced volumes in the first half of last year. Equity underwriting fees were down 5%, a little better than the market with strong performance in North America, and debt underwriting fees were up 32% relative to a weak prior year quarter on strong flow issuance, as well as acquisition financing. Treasury services revenue of $950 million was up 5%, driven by higher rates and operating balance growth, as well as higher fees on increased payment volumes. Moving on to markets, another strong quarter with the highest revenue on record for a fourth quarter in total, and for each of 16 common equities. And like last quarter, the strength was broad-based. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 24% year-on-year, in part flattered by a weaker fourth quarter last year, but on the whole driven by momentum carried forward from the third quarter, and the ability to capture flow from higher volatility and client activity. The back drop was that of a healthier global economic outlook, increased optimism, and global political developments. More specifically, fixed income revenue was up 31%, as we saw increased client risk appetite for spread product, as well as client's actively hedging commodities in a better energy market. And equities revenue was up 8% reflecting strong performance in derivatives. Credit costs were a benefit of nearly $200 million, primarily driven by oil and gas and metals and mining. And finally, expense of $4.2 billion was down 6% year-on-year, primarily on lower compensation resulting in a comp to revenue ratio of 27% for the full year. Moving on to page 7, and commercial banking, another outstanding quarter in commercial banking, with net income of $687 million, record revenue of $2 billion, and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 12% and expense down 1%, with a overhead ratio of 38%. Loan growth remains robust, credit performance remains strong, and client sentiment has improved. Revenue growth was driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth, with loan spreads holding steady, as well as higher IB revenue with good underlying deal flow. For the full year, IB revenue was a record $2.3 billion, up 5% year-on-year as we gained share. Expense was down slightly, with the impact of impairment in the aircraft leasing business last year offset by investments we've made in bankers and technologies this year. We ended the year with record loan balances of $189 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in both C&I and CRE. C&I loans were up 9%, as the investments we've made in specialized industry coverage, as well as adding over 130 net new bankers this year contributed to growth. And CRE loans were up 19%. Finally credit performance remains strong, with a net charge-off rate of 11 basis points, driven by a couple of oil and gas mains largely reserved for. And we saw a modest increase in loan loss reserves driven by select client downgrades. In CRE, we had no net charge-offs, and we reiterate three quarters of this portfolio is multi-family lending, to own as a stabilized Class B and C properties in supply-constrained markets. And the remainder is real estate developers that we know well, and we continue to be disciplined, and limit exposures to riskier segments of the market. Leaving the commercial bank, and moving on to asset management on page 8. Asset management reported net income of $586 million, with a 30% pre-tax margin and an ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher deposit NII and continued loan growth, predominantly offset by prior period asset disposals. Expense of $2.2 billion was down 1% year-on-year. For the full year, we had long-term net inflows of $23 billion in a challenging environment, driven predominantly by fixed income, multi asset and alternatives. In addition, we gathered $24 billion of liquidity flows this year. However, for the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $21 billion, obviously disappointing. But on a more positive note, we saw liquidity inflows of $35 billion this quarter, gaining share and strengthening our leadership position during this period of money market reform. AUM grew 3% year-on-year, and overall client assets 4% to $1.8 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively, driven by net inflows, as well as higher market levels. And our long-term investment performance remained solid, with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartile over five years. And we had record loan balances up 4%, and record deposit balances up 9%. Moving to page 9, and corporate, Treasury and CIO was flat quarter-on-quarter, with a net loss of around $200 million, and other corporate was a loss of $144 million primarily driven by legal expense. Turning to page 10, and the outlook, looking forward to the first quarter, expect net interest income for the Firm to be up modestly, reflecting the impact of the December rate hike, as well as continued loan growth. For asset management, expect revenue will be slightly less than $3 billion, reflecting seasonality of performance fees. And recall that last year's first quarter included a $150 million gain on the sale of an asset. On expense, expect CCB to be up around $150 million sequentially on higher auto lease depreciation, as well as seasonally higher compensation and marketing, and expect expense in the commercial bank to be up quarter-on-quarter to around $775 million as we continue to invest. Obviously, we're looking forward to Investor Day, and we'll give you more detailed 2017 guidance then. So to wrap up, a record fourth quarter and a record year, both net income and EPS demonstrating the strength of the platform. We enjoyed revenue growth, we met our expense and capital commitments, increased payouts to shareholders, and generated good returns on higher capital. As we move into the New Year, we remain well-positioned, and are excited about the opportunities to grow the Business by serving our clients and communities. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A. Operator? Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So hey, Ken, you guys have a busy day today. So I would say that, the first quarter is always a quarter in which we have a bunch of different factors. And most notably, you also have day count issues in the first quarter. So I can go through that, but I would say most of the benefit which we expect to be up modestly will be driven by the rate increase, with growth being offset by day count. That's sort of fundamentally how to think about it. It's probably more instructive to think about the full year. And so, if you recall back to the third quarter, just to kind of reorient everyone, at that point when we didn't have the December hike, we said rates flat. So on growth alone, we would expect NII for the full year to be up about $1.5 billion. Obviously, we have had the 25 basis point hike in December. And based upon that alone, so now the new rate flat, that $1.5 billion would be about $3 billion, a little over $3 billon. So for the full year, we're expecting on the December hike alone, that it would be about half volume, and about half rate.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I think the way to think about it, and again, I think we talked a little bit about it last quarter, and you maybe see it in the fourth quarter. So we've been growing our loans in the -- we said it was going to be a 10% to15%. We revised that, to be at the top end of that range. So we've been growing at around 15% core loan growth, the fourth quarter was 12%. So I wouldn't call it a deceleration per se, but it is a little bit lower. So I think going into 2017, our expectation is that we would continue to grow loans strongly, but possibly at the lower end of that range, rather than the higher. And of course, to a degree, it will depend upon our mortgage portfolio, but we intend to continue to add to that too. So sitting here today, I'd say more high single 10% plus or minus, and we'll give you more updates at Investor Day.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just taking the two things separately, Betsy, I would say the NII, up 5% is dropping to the bottom line. But as we, you saw all of our underlying drivers, across all of the businesses and volumes, transactions, everything is growing very strongly. And although we still have some work to do to finish the large expense programs, we're near the end of that. So just generally speaking, we're continuing to invest in the businesses, and we'll see the improvement in our expenses flatten out, and start to grow with volumes. And that would also support growth in non-interest revenue, outside obviously of the card phenomenon we talked to you about.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. So when we think about our investment securities portfolio, we think about it as responding to structural changes in our balance sheet, which predominantly is driven by loans and deposits. And it's always important I think, to remember, because we focus a lot on structural interest rate risk, but it also is liquidity and liquidity risk. In this quarter, there was a combination of things. You saw that we grew deposits more strongly than loans this quarter, so we had some excess cash, as well as the fact that rates rose. So two things happened in our investment securities portfolio, mortgages extended, and we did add to duration. But we have a very disciplined risk management framework that's based -- that's been consistent through time, based on our expectations of normal rates in the future, and we just executed on that strategy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we added to duration, in accordance with our framework.
MARIANNE LAKE: Great. So obviously, the Sapphire Reserve card is still quite young, or still quite new. But relative to our modeled expectations even at the intro promo premium, things are coming in, in line or better than our expectations. Now obviously, we need to continue to [back test] that [three] times. But we're very encouraged by, not only the excitement in our customer base, but also the way that the trends are performing in terms of spend and engagement. But when we introduce a new product, we intentionally introduce a very exciting premium promo, and it's intended to generate excitement. And I think you would agree it did. So we're delighted with the response that we've had. And we've actually kept it up for longer than we initially expected, but it's normal for us to come down from those intro rates, as the product becomes more mature, and that's what we are doing. But to be very clear about our expectations of the performance of the card, even at 100,000 points, we still expected the card to be a strong return and very accretive. So obviously, at a lower premium, it would be more so. But one last thing I would say, is everybody gets very interested the up front points. It's our opinion that the real value to consumers of that card happens over time with their spend behavior, and to take the points down from 100,000 to 50,000 has less than a 10% reduction in the overall value through the lifetime of an engaged customer on average.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the charge-offs came in for the year at 2.63%, which is in line with the guidance that we gave, I think in November that Kevin Watters gave. He's given guidance for 2017, as we continue to see the newer vintages seasoned, are 2.75% plus or minus. And that's still our expectation, so the newer vintages are performing in line with our expectations.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I'll give you a couple of things, and hopefully that will help. So I think a year or so ago, we talked about the fact that -- I'm going to now talk about cost of controls more broadly than just regulatory, that the cost of controls had increased for the Company by about $3 billion over several years. But that we expected they would peak and start bending down, and that is indeed what we have been seeing. Now I'm not saying that bend down is a sharp bend, as we continue to be held to very sort of hard compliance burdens. But nevertheless, we are seeing some efficiencies as we mature our processes and automate them. Offsetting against that, and one of the reasons why it may be less obvious, is that we've continued to increase our spend in cyber security, as we want to protect the bank and the customer's data. So naturally, that is happening. We are not going to continue at this point, carving out the costs of regulatory or control because that is our operating model, it's our new normal. And until we understand whether or not the forward-looking landscape is changed, we won't be able to give you any kind of idea about how and when that will impact our expenses. But we will continue to be more and more efficient. And certainly, if we are able to take a step back, and look at the rules and regulations, and the way that they are being implemented, and make rational changes to it, if that is something that is -- allows us to become more efficient, then we will certainly do that, and keep you informed.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think in the conference in November, Kevin Watters said that as we look at the new products, and we look at them growing, coming out in 2016 and into 2017, we would expect the card revenue rate for the year next year to be about 10.5%, after which as the cards and the accounts season and drive revenue growth, we should see that continue to trend back up to a level in the past.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I mean, I think that it's actual detail of retail spend, auto sales, house prices, household formation, confidence numbers. So I'm not basing it on the market, I'm just basing it -- if you look at a broad range of things, it looks like growth may have gotten a little bit better in the fourth quarter. Plus if you take a walk around the world, Japan is doing a little better, Europe is doing better. In fact, one of the IMF [or someone else] came out yesterday, and [said] the global growth is going to tick up next year. So it's just those factors.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not going to change our plans very much, because we don't really react that much to the weather, because we grow to add bankers and stuff. You know you have to do it through a cycle. I do think of it as some regulatory relief. You will see banks be more aggressive and growing, opening branches in new cities, adding to loan portfolios, seeking out clients they don't have. So I'm hoping to see a little bit of that too, but that will wait for regulatory relief.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I'm saying we don't react to the small change in the economy to how we grow and expand our business. But I just that it looks to us, if you look across the broad spectrum, capital expenditures, business confidence, consumer confidence, household building, household formation, wage income, wages going up, unemployment going down, auto sales going up, retail sales going up, it looks like it's getting stronger, not weaker. That's what it looks like to me. That's just my own personal belief.
MARIANNE LAKE: And maybe just if we give you a bit of insight into the philosophy about how we do our investment and expense budgeting. When we talk to our businesses, regardless to Jamie's point about necessarily whether the external factors are moving, the question is, what do we want to do in terms of products and services and technology and bankers and offices that we can execute on well and responsibly? And that is typically what defines us, not our appetite to invest the dollars. So I think we've told you pretty consistently that, and you've seen it. We added 130 net new bankers, we opened eight offices in the commercial bank. We're investing in technology very, very broadly, payments, digital across the Company. So I would say that, we don't feel like we've been held back in terms of our appetite to invest, because of concern around the economy. And in the same way, a more confident outlook in the economy won't step change that. But we will continue to look for great investments everywhere we can and make them.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say, just if we separate the two, and just talk for one second about banking. The fundamentals for a solid M&A year are there, and obviously there will be puts and takes depending on what happens in the policy and reforms space. But we're optimistic about a solid M&A market, but with the continuing trend of fewer mega deals, but nevertheless good flow. At ECM, looks set to be quite active, and the IPO market continuing to recover, and debt capital markets have a solid pipeline in terms of the refinance arena, but having said that, interest rates may have an impact. So I think pretty solid pipeline coming into the year, but lots of factors will ultimately affect the full year. With respect to trading, Jamie said, that we don't look at the first couple of weeks, but so far, so good. And what I would tell you is, we said this before, we're a client flow oriented business. And there will be a lot of micro and event-driven activity, and as long as it's not discontinuous, we should be able to intermediate transactions with our clients. And so far, generally there's been more risk appetite in the investor space, but that can change very quickly as we saw in previous quarters. So we will be there to support our clients. And if they are active, everything should be good, but it can change quickly.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just reminding you about our sort of philosophy on comp to revenue, we pay -- or our comp to revenue is just a calculation, obviously we pay for shareholder value-added. So you need to take into consideration the fact that we've had overtime increased capital levels and liquidity levels, and that's reflected in a declining overall comp to revenue ratio. I would say that there are three factors to it being lower. The first is the strength in performance, and the pay outs aren't linear. And as you have stronger performance, you would expect to see a lower ultimate outcome. But importantly, we were -- some tail winds in the numbers this year included a stronger dollar. So as we pay -- remember comp to revenue isn't just on the front office compensation, it all supports our salaries, benefits and compensation. And we have a large number of people that we pay not in dollars. So that was a bit of a tail wind. Some of that will carry on, but maybe not at the same level. And we also just did our normal regular hygiene and productivity, in terms of the -- how we think about the workforce and pay. At the end of the day, we pay for performance, we pay, we think very competitively, to retain the best team on the street, and make sure that our shareholders are getting a fair share of any outperformance.
JAMIE DIMON: Simplifying the securitization rules, because we've done some securitizations. We think they're excellent, but that would open up the market a little bit, clarifying the Safe Harbors on certain types of underwriting. For example, it's very hard and risky for a bank to make a loan to first time buyers, former bankruptcies, even though it could be very good people with brand new jobs, self-employed, it's hard to necessarily do all of the income verification, stuff like that. Simplifying servicing, the services standards now have, I think nationwide, we have 3,000 different standards. It's very costly. It's very expensive. It's kind of risky. If you make a mistake, the punishment is pretty high. And all those things, that should be done for the good of the United States of America, not for the good of JPMorgan Chase. And so, I do think it's too tight and there's one thing, that if you get around too quickly, it will help the housing market a little bit, it will help the housing formation, it will reduce the cost of mortgages, and make it available to more people.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Glenn.
MARIANNE LAKE: So starting off with sort of interest rates. And obviously, we've talked for an extended period of time about the fact we've positioned the Company to benefit when rates rise, we built the branches, we acquired the accounts, we've built the technology and the services. So we've been growing our deposits very strongly, and we're going to enjoy the benefits of that. With respect to how much will go to the bottom line, we have been we think appropriately conservative, when we've given you guidance about ultimately how much incremental NII we would expect in a more normal rate environment. I mean, if you go back to Investor Days of past, you would see that we said when normalized, we would expect $10 billion-plus, and embedded in that are assumptions obviously around rate paid. We think that rate paid will be higher this time in this cycle, than in previous cycles for a bunch of reasons including as you said, competition for high quality liquidity balances. But also that we are coming off of zero rates and the improvement in technology. So we've been, we think appropriately conservative, but we'll find out in the fullness of time. So far two rate hikes, absolute rates at 50 basis points, it's too early. And so far, you would expect there to be (inaudible) in there, and it's not linear, and everything is behaving quite rationally right now. So we, in fact, if anything a little better than we had modeled. So we'll keep watching it, and we think we've been thoughtful. We don't know the right answer, and we'll keep you updated as we see how things progress.
JAMIE DIMON: And just on the tax side, so other people understand, generally, yes, if you reduce the tax rates all things being equal to 20% of something, eventually that increased return will be competed away. That is a good thing. Okay, so it's not a good thing for JPMorgan Chase per se, but it's a good thing for the world, it's a good thing for growth. And a lot of studies actually show the beneficiary of that is wages. And so, it's important for people to understand that good tax policy is good for growth and the country in general. It's not just good for companies, it will eventually be competed away.
JAMIE DIMON: Listen, you aren't going to really know for probably nine months to a year exactly what it is, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. And I also, just remember the most efficient companies do benefit from things like this, more than others.
JAMIE DIMON: I think if you look at -- I mean, again, there's a lot of wood to be chopped and sausage to be made before tax reform gets done. And some of these things are brand new, they've never been talked about or done before, so you can read a lot of studies in the next six months. Obviously, interest deductibility, for banks, from a net interest income, so it doesn't directly change how you look at it. For everybody else, it affects complete industries differently. How you leverage differently, and utilities will be in a different position, and unleveraged companies. And plus, I think people will be able to convert what would have been interest expense to some other kind of expense. So let the work get done, before we spend too much time guessing about it.
MARIANNE LAKE: I also think that while interest deductibility is one point, the repatriation of cash is another point. And there are puts and takes, and you have to think, you have to see the whole package, before you can see what the net impact is. But ultimately if these things get done rationally and grow the economy, then it's good for our franchise just broadly. So don't focus on DCM, focus on the whole thing. And I think when you get the whole package, if it's done well which we hope will happen, then it will be good for the economy, good for our clients, and good for our whole franchise.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, okay. So yes, Matt, it does include the benefit of higher long end rates. And if you get the Q, and get our disclosure on net income risk, and do some math, you'll get pretty close to numbers that looks similar to that $1.5 billion or more. And then, with respect to rate sensitivity from here, clearly it's not linear. So you can see, if we just look at the third quarter, the first 100 basis points -- this is an illustration of $2.8 billion, 200 basis points is $4.5 billion. So as we clip away, 25 basis points a time, our $2.8 billion will start to come down. And so, that's broadly the outlook.
JAMIE DIMON: And the next 10-Q will show the next -- (multiple speakers).
MARIANNE LAKE: And the next 10-Q will show the next.
JAMIE DIMON: But obviously, it's less and less as rates go up. It's not linear.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, what you saw happen in 2016 was not only obviously a rotation from securities and deploying deposits into loans, but also we took a very large amount of non-operating deposits out of the balance sheet in 2016. So that is having an impact. But we would expect to continue to grow our loans, to grow our deposits strongly to manage the overall balance sheet through our investment securities portfolio. And from here, if everything continues to be as the market implies, we should see margin expansion.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So answer is across the metals and mining and energy, we have a little over $1.5 billion of reserves. I mean, there is a normal level of reserves that we will have, that would be a large chunk of that. And as you saw in 2016, we did take charge-offs of a little less than $300 million. So we will continue to likely see on a name specific basis, as people work through their business models, that there will be more charge-offs. But ultimately, if energy stays stable or improves, and of course, we have to see that be somewhat sustained, and find its way flowing through the financial statements of our clients. Then as we upgrade them, God willing, then we will see more reserve releases. But it's going to take some time. We'll start to see some of that -- and think about the large reserves we took. We took them at the tail end of 2015 and into 2016, we'll start to see new financial data from our clients. We'll start to do the borrowing base redeterminations, and look at the impact of prices on reserves in the spring. And so, we'll start getting some data this year, and so we may see some more releases, but it's going to come through over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, I would say that when I talk about the overall core loan growth going down, still being strong, it does reflect the fact that we've been seeing very strong outperformance in our growth over the course of the last couple of years, particularly in commercial term lending. And while we continue to believe there's great opportunities there, they will be lower. So we've been printing in the teens pretty consistently, and I would say, it will be less red hot, and maybe more in the high single-digits, but we're going to keep you updated.
MARIANNE LAKE: There's still plenty of opportunity.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, I don't know that I would ever try to decide what moment in time, is the pinnacle. But I would say, you saw us invest heavily in the business in 2015 and 2016 across a number of different fronts. You saw us proactively renegotiating the card program deals for the vast majority of our portfolio, and investing very heavily in exciting new products. And in both cases, while it has had an impact on our revenues, in one case in the short-term, and another case more structurally, in both cases these are still very attractive returns. And so, card is still a very attractive ROE business, very important to our customers. We are after deep engaged relationships through time with them. And so, we are going to continue to invest in growth.
MARIANNE LAKE: At this point, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: We did try to actually analyze it, because we got asked a lot about what was secular. So you could break apart your exotic derivatives, certain types of CDOs. Of course, across the whole spectrum, there are things that disappeared and won't be done no more, for better or worse. In some cases, by the way, like a CDOs it didn't go away, because the person is still a credit buyer. So they just went to another product, but that was our best estimate. I don't want to over do it or anything like that. I also said that the actual market making requirements are going to be going up over time, I'm talking about over 20 years, I'm not talking about the next quarter or next month. And remember, we don't run the business next quarter, next month, because assets under management are going up, and needs of corporations are going up. The fixed income mortgage is going to go up, the needs for FX is going up, the needs for hedging is going up. So over time, we know there's going to be a cyclical increase. And we just try to estimate how much of the [downturn] is cyclical, and so, there will be a flip side of that. And I think you might have gotten to the end of the secular, end of cyclical decline.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I will obviously, give you a lot more detail about all of this at Investor Day, but really quick, because I knew the $19 billion would get some excitement. If you go back, and talk to yourself to look at the specifics on the slide, you should see that the $19 billion that he guided to did have some assumptions about some legal costs in there. The CIB didn't have legal costs in the year. And as a result, it's still a little higher on an apples-to-apples basis than that would imply. Additionally, I talked about the tail winds in terms of a stronger dollar. Now for full disclosure we have intentionally reinvested some of that, but it was a tail wind that meant that apples-to-apples, it would still be a little higher. I'd tell you that compared to the targets that they set, we still have a few hundred million dollars to deliver on, and Daniel will go through that at Investor Day.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, so just to talk about rate trading for a second. You're right, that it was a part of the strength story in the fourth quarter this year. It was also a strong fourth quarter last year, which is pretty much the only reason why we didn't call it out as a bigger driver of the year-over-year growth, but it was a strong performance in the quarter. And we would expect that to continue. It's much more interesting to -- for our clients to trade around a moving yield curve and rates above zero. So as we see rates normalize, we would fully expect that to be ultimately a beneficiary to the franchise in terms of clients trading, and positioning, and hedging around that over time. And so, [wonderful] if that would be the case. In terms of the excitement and the enthusiasm of our businesses, lending versus we're enthusiastic about all of our businesses, and would want to defend share and grow them all. I mean, the reality of the CIB revenue performance in markets, and in general, it was very strong in 2016. So we will try our hardest to replicate that. But it will be a challenging comparison, but we're proud of it. So we gained share competitively over the course of the last couple years, and so I don't think you should necessarily expect that we can continue to gain share at that pace; but defend it we will.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the better way to look at CIB lending, is it's kind of episodic, and goes in and out. Corporations, a lot of corporations don't need to borrow, and when they do, it may be inconsistent. It might be because of M&A or something like that. Our [bridge] book will always be driven by certain types of activity, so the loan book isn't something -- the CIB loan book isn't something you're going to say, that you're growing. That is more serving clients in the way they need. One of the things I just want to point out which is, of course, all of our businesses, but just take trading in particular is, we're always creating efficiencies. Part of what we're investing is big data, is [trade] through processing, electronic exchanges, online services. I think 97% of FX -- I think it's 50% to 60% of US interest rate swaps, all these things have become electronic and digitized, as trade through for clients. So that's where some of the investments are going. And you're going to see more of that not less, but it also creates another round of efficiencies every time we do that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning. How are you?
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so we talked before about -- we had in certain markets already pulled back, not necessarily because we had a crystal ball, but because we saw them getting soft before the energy decline. Dallas and Houston would be examples, parts of Brooklyn would be examples of that. I would say, watching more carefully -- you've seen us, we have that there is some supply coming through in markets, Seattle, Denver, D.C., San Francisco. We're still very active there, but just keeping an eye on those markets. But the supply pipeline, while it's real does not look like it did when we saw the real pressure on the term lending business, the real estate business back in the 1980s and 1990s. So we're keeping an eye on it.
JAMIE DIMON: (Inaudible) I'll add, we don't want to give you all of our secrets in that business, but we do (inaudible). But we're very disciplined about where we see supply, and supply and demand and pricing, and we would have no problem, not growing at all. We don't sit at meetings here and say, can you grow at 10%, can you grow to [12%]? No, if we can't meet what we think is proper risk return, we're not going to grow at all. We'll shrink. We have no problem doing that. And so, the other thing I want to point out about CTLs, the exceptional performance of the CTLs through the last Great Recession. I mean, we were really pleased with how that happened. So we try to look at all these things through the cycle, not just what are they doing in good times.
MARIANNE LAKE: We don't disclose that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, there's a couple different things. First of all, we, about a little more than half of our originations are jumbo. We retain all of those. And then, when you look at the conforming space, it's really, honestly, consistently the best execution decision. And so in particularly in this quarter, it speaks a bit more to our correspondent conforming volume, it's the lowest margin product. And it does somewhat frequently toggle backwards and forwards in terms of better execution, whether we would retain or sell it. But we intend to keep adding to our portfolio, we like the mortgage asset classes. Even those spreads have compressed in the fourth quarter, OAS and ROEs are holding up. And so, I would expect us to continue to grow it strongly. And from quarter to quarter, it may go up or down a few percent, but over a year, we'll continue to add to the portfolio.
MARIANNE LAKE: No.
JAMIE DIMON: I think there was a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, particularly around actively managed product. I think you're accurate. But we haven't seen everybody else yet, but I think you will be true, when we see everybody.
JAMIE DIMON: That's a really hard question to answer. I'd have to think about that a little bit.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think that -- I mean, everything is going to end up being reasonably named specific, so I mean, that may be true in some cases. But for some companies in industries, where deregulation and that would be more helpful. But generally as I said the trend is towards lower -- I'm sorry, less mega deals, more flow, and the fundamentals are in pretty good shape, and then there will possibly be tail winds, in terms of tax reform and other things. So I think net-net, we think the underlying flow in the M&A market, and the fundamentals are set to have a pretty positive year.
MARIANNE LAKE: We'll see. No more questions, operator?
MARIANNE LAKE: All right. Thank you, everyone.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you very much.",0.29000000000000004,-0.7449999999999974,0,0.1293396915974838,0.15400303161301773
12,Q4_2008,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you very much. I just have a few comments then we will open up to questions. On the Investment Bank I think there are two things I'd like to talk about. One is the results on the client side have really been exceptional. The market share gains. I think it is true on investment banking and on trading. We see a lot more client flow and we think we are going to do very well servicing investor and corporate clients. We get asked a lot about Bear Stearns and the impact of Bear Stearns. I hesitate to say this a little bit. We still expect to get $1 billion of earnings from Bear Stearns late in '09, predominately prime brokerage is doing well and energy and commodities, but it also helped and aided our business in equities, fixed income and really across the board we got some terrific bankers in the deal. However, it is hard to separate out positions that we inherited that we decided to keep or didn't hedge right or something like that. But when we took on Bear, we did take on a lot more risky assets and we've got them down substantially. We probably lost several billion dollars more than we would have in the year had we not done Bear. Again, it's hard to really separate what was our responsibility and what we inherited, because we could have sold some of the things we inherited. The retail business, we are working hard in WaMu. We are still very excited about it. We think this is still approximately what we told you last time what it is going to do for this company. We are very excited about the ability to build small business, private banking, asset management and middle market on top of the retail branch platform there. We hope to consolidate all of WaMu systems by the end of the year. That's the point where we get very comfortable about how we can grow it. We will be changing the brand in California at the end of March, because we think it is important to start using the new name in California. You might have saw yesterday that we closed the [broker channel] business, which we are, obviously, a very big player and we still think we are going to get very good at it. Though we don't know the real ongoing profitability of all the mortgage business, we did close the remaining broker business that we did, mostly in the prime side, and we just think that's a smart thing to do, because a lot of the business that came through that side was just not our kind of quality. Card Services, Mike gave you some numbers where losses will be higher. Now we don't totally see that yet. But we are just kind of assuming that unemployment is going to go up and, obviously, that's going to dry Card Services. We also owe you, we are not going to do it now, some comments on the new UDAP. So when I think we have Investor Day about what that might mean for the business and how we might adopt a change for UDAP. Suffice to say here, it probably will drive profits lower and reduce the amount of credit that you can make availability and the way you can make it available to consumers, but we think we can adjust to it over time in a fairly reasonable way. Commercial Bank, all I can say is just really great results. While we adding to reserves, NPLs and credit losses haven't gone up that much, they have to go up. You cannot have an environment like this where you don't see a lot of stress and strain in middle market, so we do expect loss to go up there. Treasury and Security Services kind of gang busters. I think one of the important things there to keep in mind is we also didn't have any of the pitfalls. We feel really good how we run that business. Asset Management, results down, obviously, because assets under management are down. But I think the important thing here also is we have grown the business, more bankers, more net inflows and we also stayed away from a lot of the pitfalls that have beset some of the folks in that business. Mike mentioned the balance sheet. We think we are in very good shape. I should add that we did add in the back, and you see in the supplement, that our Investment portfolios, the parent, have gone from $116 billion to over $160 billion, as we try to invest on this excess liquidity we have, et cetera. So the credit kind of drives some of those ratios down, but is completely discretion on our part how we use that. In the short run, it drives slightly higher income in Corporate as we buy some of those portfolios I want to mention two other things that are important, really kind of one other thing, which is, we started this Way Forward campaign about all the things that JPMorgan is doing to help the system, to help our clients, the small business, middle market, investment banking, and there is going to be a lot more coming about that. I think we did at the forefront of mortgage modifications. We have some more information about that coming up in a day or so, because we think there are more things we can do to help keep people in their homes and do a better job for the consumer. In the press release we announced also that in the quarter we extended new credit of over $100 billion, because there have been a lot of questions out there about whether banks are making loans. I think we are speaking for lots of banks here, people are out making loans. This year, this quarter alone, I think we did four million new credit cards. So we extended credit card loans, corporate loans, middle market loans. We bought $1.4 billion bond issue when no one else would bid on it from Illinois. So we are in business. So regarding businesses, the loan demand as actually dropping rather dramatically. We've also in the interbank market we have had on average $40 billion or $50 billion out in the interbank market. That is also a form of lending. So people ask are banks lending to each other. Well, I think some are and trying to help the system that way. And all of this is helped by the TARP. So we think it is a valid question for people to ask what have you done with the TARP money. We do say it is hard to separate exactly what is TARP money, because remember we are making loans all the time. But we are trying to follow the intent and spirit of TARP, which is to help the economy of the United States recover and make sure we are financing people. We even have done some major large syndicated leverage finance loans and I'll mention two, Inbev and Mars, but there are several others. So we are still in business. Obviously the cost of money is higher for clients and people have tightened up some of the underwriting standards, but we are still in business. We are still trying to the best we can both for our shareholders and the country. So we will stop there and open for questions. Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: So we are really trying to figure that out, and all I'm going to say at this point is, it's legislation, we don't know if it's going to get passed or not get passed. I do think it could have a pretty chilling effect on consumer lending in general, and drive up bankruptcies in general if people go to the bankruptcy courts more, but you really have to wait until the specific things come out to see what the GSEs do, the FHA, and all the real specifics around, so we're kind of reserving final judgment on how that would work. In the meantime, we're going forward with what we think is a very good program to modify mortgages, sometimes they include principal reduction. But remember, the really important thing for consumers is much more affordability and cashflows. Principal is an artificial concept when you talk about cash over a long period of time, so if people can afford a home, that's what you really want to do. It's also very important in mortgage modification to reunderwrite, to do real income verification, real appraisals to make sure the people can and want to live there and do the second time around maybe what wasn't done so well what wasn't done the first time around.
JAMIE DIMON: Listen I think most of the companies are doing it, have staffed up a lot to be able to handle these kind of things, in any event, you're going to do it one by one, that is the right way to do it. It's a lot of work. But obviously when the home prices stabilize, foreclosure will go down a little bit. We will get through it.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember we got a lot of new deposits in. We bought a lot of mortgages, doing CLO's a little bit of other credit related product. You're going to see us do that. We are getting enormous spreads. We think some of them are very safe and sound. We want to make money in that portfolio but we're being cautious about how we do it. We don't want to do it all at once, not making a big bet for the company.
JAMIE DIMON: We did not see a sharp increase in delinquencies in December. I think I mentioned that we don't have full visibility of why we go to 7%. That's a guess that the economy is worse and unemployment is going to hit the 7 or 8.5% number. We're just saying if that happens, unemployment credit card loss will go up. We don't know for a fact that's going to happen.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: The answer, it does. We're really happy that it had a big negative in the third quarter, and a little bit of recovery in the fourth quarter, I think we got the number that costs, at one point costing $100 million a month, that's disappearing, but it doesn't benefit us next year just the extra cost disappears. Some of the cost by the way ends up as a benefit in Corporate. We get the benefit on the other side in the other place in the company.
JAMIE DIMON: John, it's very hard to tell because what we see is the consumer is spending less, so card spend was down a fairly dramatic 8% in the fourth quarter, payments are way down too, so balances, we don't know how the two are going to intercept. What we do know and I believe is that our share is going up. Remember we are very prime. We think we are in the more secure part of the segment, and we've added a lot of clients. So we continue to market, it's just very hard to tell what is going to happen to balances next year.
JAMIE DIMON: I think ex the extraordinary gain, it was a little better than $0.10.
JAMIE DIMON: Still our outlook there.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not going to talk about the quarter specifically, but it's hard to separate, we took on Bear, we consolidated risk positions. We obviously started making decisions what to buy, what to sell, what to hedge, not to hedge. But it did add a lot of risk positions to our company in areas we already had risk, like the SPO, securitized product, leverage loan, some credit, and it did cost us net net, however you look at it, several billion dollars this year. On that several billion, unlike other things, didn't have the offset of comp because we are not punishing everyone in the Investment Bank for the fact that they are close to our Investment Bank. I think our people in the Investment Bank did an exceptional job similarly, the people of Bear, the systems of Bear and trying to manage and derisk in what turned out to be a terrible environment.
JAMIE DIMON: We are not going to do that right now but we're going to give more information about new credit, renewals of credit. But renewals of credit are credit. I don't want to get in to the gain to act like we are obligated to renew credit all the time. But we are going to do that, and the reason we said 100 plus is because we want to make sure we get the right numbers out there. But you will see us give some numbers like that. Middle market, large corporate, even our investment portfolio, I mentioned we added $50 or $60 billion, that is extending credit too. We probably bought more mortgage securities than the government did this quarter. Bit of an exaggeration but.
JAMIE DIMON: We never were exuberant raising the dividend, and this company has enormous earnings power, and we feel an obligation to pay the dividend. We feel pretty good about it. We are not that concerned about it.
JAMIE DIMON: One is we feel one is obligation to the shareholders that you tell them you raise the dividend, you intend to pay it. Should be consistent and steady, we never raised it to exorbitant numbers, so it wasn't something was a yoke around our necks. So the TARP is a 3 to 5 year preferred or something like that. Not directly comparable and we eventually will repay the TARP, and move on when we get through all of. This now you can't repay the TARP, part of the agreement is that it wasn't repayable without being replaced. You can't replace that type of thing in today's market.
JAMIE DIMON: Good.
JAMIE DIMON: Part of the compensation does relate to what I mentioned about Bear Stearns. We hope to gain share. But there will always be tough competitors in the investment banking business. The investor side trading, client trading, we have it's hard to tell we gained share, because if you look at surveys and Greenwich and other things, anecdotally, it looks like we have an equity cash trading, so we hope to gain share there, and the investment banking side, covering corporate clients, ECM, DCM, M&A, stuff like that, we gained share. This is a tough business. We don't assume that it will be easy going forward. We will keep investing in the parts of the business we think will grow. Obviously there are parts of the business which change, and you disinvest a little bit, and that will be in areas you know about. Partially securitized products, Some structured products et cetera, where you're not going to have the volumes you had before.
JAMIE DIMON: I mentioned that relative to card. I think it's fair to say that in my opinion is the minimum you are going to see. That's an opinion. That's not built in to every number we do. That's just an opinion.
JAMIE DIMON: When it comes to mortgages and stuff?
JAMIE DIMON: The answer, loss reserves is a different thing which is looking forward and projecting forward, and yes we do assume some deterioration, which assumes higher in general home prices going down and unemployment going up. But Meredith, it is not a direct correlation. I agree with you, it will drive those things, these are just estimates and models. Common sense tells you it's going to get worse and we should be prepared for that.
JAMIE DIMON: Investment bank, obviously a lot of the change you see taking place if in the Investment Bank, I think Steve Black and Bill Winters have been pretty aggressive in resizing and responding to the environment, what we don't want to do is overreact and not do a good job servicing clients. Job one is to make sure we are in the market, servicing the client, trading, calling in clients, so we are not going to have an overreaction on that. We don't think the businesses are going to go away. We think some are. The way you look at it, and I don't have the head count numbers in front of me. When we added Bear Stearns we added 6000 people to the IB Net, I think the head count looking forward is going to be more like as if you didn't add Bear Stearns at all. So we've probably eliminated somehow, on all the things we do, another 6,000 jobs. Now that will also come down during the course of the year as the plans in place are implemented.
JAMIE DIMON: Acquisitions, we would never say never. Obviously we are busy with Bear Stearns and WaMu, both which we think are important to do and do right. The hurdle rate would have to be really high to do an acquisition. The price would have to be really good. The ability to execute unquestionable and the business logic unquestionable. We are not out there looking, if that happens, obviously we will think about it over time. And second one, divestitures, there's nothing on the table we plan to divest.
JAMIE DIMON: We are attracting hot money. We don't need it.
JAMIE DIMON: Within what we kind of expected. We knew were going to do some of that, a lot of changes in the rate curve, and deposit cost, but net net is probably a wash.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you very much everybody. Look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care, bye.",-0.44,-0.0430000000000004,0,0.10262579405905023,0.1358897275563942
13,Q4_2009,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Glenn, this is Jamie. You're still going to see negative revenue because of a fairly large number and the reserve for it.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, are you talking about repurchasing reserves again?
JAMIE DIMON: They're all doing that and is anything that you bought or originated that is subject to some repurchase reserves. I think you can assume the broker side will be worse.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, we've always had a high stock component, it's will be a little bit higher this year than normal and that's why Mike says it's a one or two point swing this year.
JAMIE DIMON: It's basically in line with all of the G20, FSA, IIF, Federal Reserve's, FSVs and all of the other acronyms you come up with.
JAMIE DIMON: Our interest rate exposure is high and it's way down, so honestly I wouldn't worry about it that much and Mike mentioned we're selling parts of the portfolio and reducing it kind of as we speak, but it does not mean we're adjusting the rates are going up right away. We just position ourselves to protect ourselves from both higher rates and I think really the far more important thing is volume, it's like is the economy recovering. If the economy is recovering then business will be much better.
JAMIE DIMON: You know, look. You guys are just as good at forecasting the economy as anybody else and we've seen delinquencies getting a little bit better, we saw credit card spend be up a little bit. We see, we think loans in middle market are actually starting to level off and we see small business demand actually go up, so we don't know if that's because we're trying to generate any bankers but there are signs of good signs out there, but we don't know.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you'll see, I think assets will kind of start a normal growth path at this point, we had a lot of reduction to the Bear Stearns, some of these illiquid assets which we've sold and certain loans and stuff like that so I would look at fairly normal growth. Capital will probably go up to $40 billion approximately, equity capital and Basel III is really early. The tax they just said could have some peculiar effects if you're really going to tax 15 basis points on non-deposit assets and liabilities and then all of a sudden you're affecting repo markets and matchbook markets so we don't really know the effect of all of that but the underlying business is strong. You can see a lot of corporations or funding and there's more M&A talk, so the business itself is healthy and the balance sheet will reflect that to some extent.
JAMIE DIMON: If I were you, Guy, I wouldn't focus too much on trading VAR. It's always a good one point measure day-to-day but not an accurate measure of risk so remember for a lot of products, it's 12 months of historical volatility of the securities, and that means that every week you're dropping out an old week and you're adding a new week, so all year or for the most part this year you're adding a benign week and dropping out a volatile week and that probably accounts for a huge amount of it, and then illiquid assets are down and some of the more volatile assets are down too.
JAMIE DIMON: No, in terms of the P&L swing a couple hundred million each way.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me just refer to one benchmark which is Tier 1 common, okay? That's an 8.8% and it goes down this quarter by 40 basis points or so because of FASB 166 and it may drop another 30 or 40 in the first quarter next year because of new market risk rolls. We don't know that number yet. It could go up or down but we're still very healthy. At one point we're going to revert to normal growth which will use capital, right? And so but once you see a recovery, and earnings start to go up and reserves start to come down, there will be plenty of excess capital and that's when you might see the dividend.
JAMIE DIMON: But the other thing to keep in mind is Basel III which is probably a couple years away, everyone is going to keep that in mind and how they're looking at the balance sheet because no one wants to be caught short in capital, particularly if someone is going to be punitive about it.
JAMIE DIMON: Not really I think we've said we really want to see a real recovery before we do that because we don't want to have to do this again, just in case you have another dip down here.
JAMIE DIMON: And then there's the general one, how much capital, the new real standards which people don't really know yet.
JAMIE DIMON: It's about a breakeven but if Basel II goes around and Basel II will change.
JAMIE DIMON: We've got plenty of capital but the question is what's the new standard? I mean not only the capital requirements but the rules adding to more risk weighted assets and more capital but in the old days when the stress test was placed it was 4% Tier 1 common was you had to be able to maintain through the adverse case. We have double that. Is that 4% going to be 5% or 6% or 7% and no bank is going to be want to be caught short of that because the markets and the regulators, and the government has become punitive about that point. Everyone is going to want to hold more capital.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, Mike, we don't know when the recovery is. What I said is I think you'll have an inflection point where it would generate a lot more capital than we need even after accounting for needing more capital to make up the accounting change and the Basel II change.
JAMIE DIMON: The earnings going up, the balance sheet levelizing and loan loss reserves need to eventually start to come down.
JAMIE DIMON: And restructurings. Remember a lot of loans have been non-performing in the large corporate world get restructured and taken out by DIPs etc.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, first of all we don't know what the real tax is yet and it seems to cover US and non-US, that doesn't help you. I think the one unintended consequence in the back of my mind is how it affects the match book, financing businesses etc. because that really becomes a real cost in a low margin type of business so we'll just wait and see. We run the business to serve customers and grow. We don't run it necessarily for that stuff so we really have to wait and see the details of when it all sorts out.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, again, I think the real important thing is that you really don't believe that anyone can be too big to fail. Remember the markets never traded financial companies like it was too big to sell, neither the stocks nor the bonds, they traded with huge spreads and stuff like that, so but I guess the model if you were going to have something is like insurance, like an FDIC type or something like that and if it comes across as doing business for certain type companies.
JAMIE DIMON: (Inaudible).
JAMIE DIMON: It's mostly MBS and a couple other things there.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, remember we do modifications of our own and we do the government modifications and I do think they're kind of new, it was complex, and I think people will get better at it over time, Meredith. We have not thought of a better way to do it than loan by loan, which is, does the person want to live there, can they afford to live there, and we really think that the payment, how much you're paying is more important than principal. Even if you are going to do something on principal, to do it right you have to do it loan by loan and it effectively becomes a similar kind of thing. The difficulty is the loan by loan part and we've asked the government and I think they tried to streamline a little bit the HAMP programs because there's too much paperwork involved in it so a lot of the reasons we're not getting to final modifications half the time we don't finish the paperwork, so they were meeting the lower payments but they weren't finishing the paperwork so we're trying to get better at it, get it streamlined honestly, we rack our brains to figure out if there's a better way to do it and you can do it more macro than loan by loan but once you start talking about macro, you're going to get involved in a lot of issues about whether people live there, whether they have the ability to pay, whether they were honest when they first told people how much their incomes were, so we're working through it.
JAMIE DIMON: We're trying to do this, look, we're trying to have ideas and they are trying to have ideas but if we had a brilliant one we would be very supportive of doing it. We want to do the right thing for the people.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think if there's a macro government force on something like that yes, it could have a fairly significant effect on loan loss reserves and losses, et cetera.
JAMIE DIMON: Honestly Meredith you probably know as well as we do.
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, because basically, you put up the reserves the stuff is held off balance sheet. That is the 40 basis points and it will add about--.
JAMIE DIMON: It's just an accounting adjustment below the line but it does reduce book capital by the after-tax amount and there's some other adjustments in there, that's probably about $4 billion of capital.
JAMIE DIMON: FICC was really across-the-board, but there were a couple of small negative one shot items which I think was clean up, and it's been so far this year is fine. We expect volumes to be good but again, you guys, you can forecast that as well as we can. You got the same data we get generally industry wide and this year so far has had a nice start.
JAMIE DIMON: So the financial side before any changes to reserves, varying obviously the cost of credit, we'll lose $1 billion in the first quarter and in the second. There will be a point in time in my opinion reserves come down, possibly will go up, so obviously the impact might be different than that. We took this as an opportunity to design new products and i, if you watch TV at all, you've seen our Sapphire ads, our Blueprint ads, our Ink ads and the new small business product. We think we have great new products and we're spending the money to roll them out and the marketing costs a lot of money in this business, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars so you didn't see us reduce marketing expenses, or at least if we did, it's very modest in this recession. But eventually you'll have a turnaround in the business and good product and good services and we've done what we can do obviously for the law changes and we'll see a turn in the business.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, we really prefer to book it but there is not the legislation, it's hard to tell what legal entities of the people, who it relates to, how it relates, so we can't. But it's not, you're talking about several hundred million dollars at one point, then it could be more than that, it could be less than that or it depends on how the legislation turns out. And that would be a first or second quarter item when it's finalized.
JAMIE DIMON: Those decisions are made asset by asset and like I said some of those was not sales as much as they were restructurings. So we had non-performing loans and a couple had restructured, raised money and moved on and the balances come down, they come out of non-performing. We try to make the economic decision. We don't try to manage the balance sheet or NPAs or something. Everything is economic.
JAMIE DIMON: I separate accounting from capital, the derivatives and stuff like that it wouldn't matter as much. The initial ones that came out would require a lot more capital so we're double counting a lot of things. And then the liquidity one, I don't personally understand what they're looking for. Was that a Basel III thing?
JAMIE DIMON: But you know what? I'd put that one in a category of it's years away. It needs to be done right. It's years away. The industry is going to have plenty of capital before we ever get to those years. But I'm not going to worry about it that much. But the early indications they put out would be a lot more capital.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm talking about Middle Market now, it's possible, I'd say level out. I'm not sure about an increase but it's possible and it's really the economy. If you see the economy start to grow, yes, we'll see the loans go up. The large corporate loans, which are down a lot, that is more bond markets, the companies can finance elsewhere and they're doing that.
JAMIE DIMON: Say it again?
JAMIE DIMON: It was pretty significant quarter-over-quarter in terms of pick up and what I don't know is we're doing a lot of advertising and adding bankers, so I don't know if the pick up was the whole industry or just us. When you see other banks report, you'll get a better feel for that. Obviously we've been trying to support in every way we can the economy and any small business programs and other things that people do would be great. I think that what's going to drive small business will be the same thing that drives everything else, which is the return to the health of the economy. That will drive most of these things. And we don't know that anymore than you do.
JAMIE DIMON: No. There's so many items that go through something like FICC, but there's a couple hundred items, couple hundred million dollars maybe. We hope to do better in FICC. I would say it was a little disappointing this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you've seen a lot of the tightening. They're back to pretty active markets, tight bid/ask. And it's different by product but I think you're back to a fairly competitive situation, which is good for the world and the economy and not necessarily good for the trading books.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: Good question.
JAMIE DIMON: That's what we have you for.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, generally.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we had recoveries in some categories, so yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike mentioned before, there was modest recovery and you saw that in the release of reserve line.
JAMIE DIMON: So it's in the numbers and Mike normalized it for you already.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it is up to us so that's how we get there. I mean, I would say if we were just trying to help you normalize it, it would probably normalize closer to 40 or maybe closer to 38%, but remember we charge for capital and expenses and it's profit-based and all that, so it could move around but I think a good rule of thumb is to expect 40%.
JAMIE DIMON: There's a reason why it might be close enough to 40% next year, if you amortize last year's stuff.
JAMIE DIMON: 35% would be the level.
JAMIE DIMON: But always remember when your earnings are lower than they should be, that rate becomes a lot more volatile because of certain tax deductions and audits and stuff like that.
JAMIE DIMON: Honestly I don't have-- do you remember the number, Mike?
JAMIE DIMON: We're doing more and we've got some slightly higher LTVs, but do you have the number?
JAMIE DIMON: It's still very small So we'll probably be doing more of it in the future.
JAMIE DIMON: You got us. We just know stuff like you see for the first time. It might surprise you we generally agree with the concept that the industry should pay for its own clean up. But TARP got extended to a lot of things other than banks, like insurance companies and car companies, so I don't understand why we should pay for that. We've already paid for that.
JAMIE DIMON: Yeah, I would not refer to JPMorgan because we don't have a tremendous amount of real estate exposure at risk though in the Commercial Bank a good chunk of our losses come out of the real estate side. What I was referring to is that values are already way down. That's already happened different parts of the country, 20, 30, 40%. We've seen new money come in and how it gets recognized on financial statements, some banks have reserved for it, some of its come, it's probably causing a lot of the banks to go bankrupt, it's because of their commercial real estate exposure. Some of it has been mark-to-market in CMBS, some held by pension plans, what I referred to, I don't think it's going to be a tremendous hit to the economy from here. I think it's in the numbers, it's in the values, it's in peoples minds and yes, quite a bit more needs to be recognized on certain financial statements.
JAMIE DIMON: It doesn't change anything relating to international consumer businesses, which as you know we're not in, so it's a big strategic issue that we'll deal with over time.
JAMIE DIMON: No.

14,Q2_2019,"
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to thank Marianne for nearly 7 years as CFO and for her support of me over many years, but particularly her support during my transition into this role. So a huge thanks to Marianne.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Thank you, James. Okay. So now onto the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported record net income of $9.7 billion and EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $29.6 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Included in these results are tax benefits of $768 million related to the resolution of a number of tax audits. Adjusting for this as well as a few other notable items that largely offset, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter. Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in Card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding; #1 in Global IB fees year-to-date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the Commercial Bank with net income of $1 billion, while continuing to invest in the business; and in Asset & Wealth Management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets. Overall for the firm, total loan growth was 2% year-on-year, but down 1% sequentially. Important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in Home Lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm. Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage. Now on to Page 2 and some more detail about our second quarter results. Revenue of $29.6 billion was up $1.2 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was up approximately $900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher rates. And noninterest revenue was up approximately $300 million year-on-year, largely driven by the absence of the card rewards liability adjustment we took in the prior year. Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, noninterest revenue was about flat, with strong performance in Consumer across Auto lease, Home Lending production and Consumer & Business Banking, offset by lower Markets revenue and IB fees as previously guided. Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately $250 million. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.1 billion, down 5% year-on-year. In Consumer, credit costs of $1.1 billion were flat, but higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases. And in Wholesale, credit performance remains favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters. Once again, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both Consumer and Wholesale. Now on to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, up more than 10 basis points versus last quarter. In the quarter, the firm distributed $7.5 billion of capital to shareholders, and as you know, the Fed did not adjust to our 2019 CCAR capital plan. We are pleased to have significant flexibility with gross repurchase capacity of up to $29.4 billion over the next 4 quarters and the Board announced its intention to increase the common dividend to $0.90 per share, effective in the third quarter. Now on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%. Loans were down slightly year-on-year driven by Home Lending down 7% reflecting the loan sale I just mentioned. However, Card loan growth was healthy, up 8%. Business Banking loans were up 2% and Auto loans and leases were flat. We saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year, with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 16%, growing across both cyclical and digital channels. Card sales were up 11% as growth remained strong across key products. And across the franchise, active mobile users were up 12% year-on-year given continued engagement in our new features. For example, customers have opened over 2 million checking and savings accounts digitally, activated over 60 million Chase offers and our enrollment in Credit Journey now exceeds 18 million. Revenue of $13.8 billion was up 11%. This increase included 2 notable items that largely offset. First, the current quarter includes a negative MSR adjustment in Home Lending, driven by updates to our model inputs and in the prior year, as I mentioned, we had a rewards liability adjustment in Cards of approximately $330 million. Consumer & Business Banking was up 11% on higher deposit NII driven by margin expansion. Home Lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances. In Cards, Merchant Services & Auto was up 18%. Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher Auto lease volumes. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 4%, driven by continued investments in the business and higher Auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. Of note, the overhead ratio was 52% and we delivered significant positive operating leverage. On Credit, this quarter included a reserve release in the Home Lending purchase credit-impaired portfolio of $400 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in Cards of $200 million. This is primarily driven by growth and to a lesser extent, mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were up $212 million. Excluding the recovery on a loan sale in Home Lending in the prior year, net charge-offs were up $80 million driven by Card as we continue to grow the portfolio. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.6 billion. As a reminder, our performance was particularly strong last year, which featured record or near-record revenues in overall IB fees and Equity Markets. With that in mind, for the quarter IB revenue of $1.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year in a market that was also down. Advisory, debt underwritings and equity underwriting fees were down 16%, 13% and 11%, respectively, reflecting lower levels of deal activity as well as a 10-year record share in equity underwriting in the prior year. It's worth noting on a year-to-date basis, we continue to rank #1 overall and have gained share across all products and regions, benefiting from our continued investment in bankers. In advisory, we grew share in announced deal volumes and announced more deals than any other bank. In debt underwriting, we also ranked #1, benefiting from our strong lead-left position in leveraged finance, and in equity underwriting, we have seen significant pickup in activity since the first quarter and we continue to benefit from our leadership positions in tech and health care where there has been some robust activity. Looking forward, the overall IB pipeline is healthy, though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year and with fewer acquisition financing and refinancing opportunities in debt underwriting. Dialogue with clients remains active and we expect strong deal flow to continue. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $5.4 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Our results include a notable gain in fixed income from the IPO of Tradeweb. Excluding this gain, Markets' revenue would have been down 6% year-on-year against a strong second quarter performance last year. Fixed Income Markets was down 3% on an adjusted basis, with relative weakness in EMEA, partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment. Equity Markets was down 12% against a record second quarter last year. Subdued client activity and a tough compare contributed to a year-on-year decline in equity derivatives. That said, cash and prime remained stable with client balances in prime reaching an all-time high. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 4% and 5% year-on-year, respectively, with organic growth being more than offset by deposit margin compression. As a reminder, similar to last quarter, deposit margin was primarily impacted by funding basis compression rather than client betas, and at the firm-wide level, there is an offset. Sequentially, Treasury Services was flat and Securities Services was up 3% on higher balances and fees. Finally, expenses of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. And the comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 28%. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances. Also worth noting here, Gross IB revenue of $1.4 billion was up 8% year-to-date on strong syndicated lending and M&A advisory activity and we continue to (inaudible) toward our long-term $3 billion target. Deposit balances were down 1% year-on-year, and importantly, up 1% sequentially as balances have largely stabilized in total, although we continue to see migration from noninterest to interest-bearing deposits. Expenses of $864 million were up 2% year-on-year, driven by ongoing investments in banker coverage and technology. Loans were up 1% and C&I loans being flat were up 3% adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio. The story here remains unchanged. We saw solid growth in areas where we've been investing, including expansion market with specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activity. CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in Commercial Term Lending where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in Real Estate Banking where we continue to be selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $29 million with a net charge-off rate of 3 basis points. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $719 million with pretax margin and ROE of 27%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels was offset by lower investment valuation gains. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year as continued investments in advisers and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees. For the quarter, we saw record net long-term inflows of $36 billion driven by fixed income and we had net liquidity inflows of $4 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, both records, were up 7%, driven by cumulative net inflows into long term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels globally. Deposits were up 2% sequentially and up 1% year-on-year and similar to the Commercial Bank, balances in total have largely stabilized. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 7% with strength in both Wholesale and Mortgage Lending. Now onto Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $828 million, including the vast majority of the tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. Revenue was $322 million, up $242 million year-on-year due to higher net interest income, driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year. And expenses of $232 million were down $47 million year-on-year. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. On this page, I'll just comment on NII, which should not be surprising given the changes to the rate environment. As you can see, we're updating our 2019 full year NII outlook to about $57.5 billion. The reduction is based on multiple scenarios, which assume, among other things, lower long-end rates and up to 3 rate cuts this year, which is consistent with current market sentiment. And as a reminder, this compares to a rate scenario that has seen 0 cuts at the time of first quarter earnings. So to wrap up, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Overall, credit is in great shape, and the earning power of the company is evident. We delivered strong returns this quarter and the diversification and scale of our business model positions us well to outperform in any environment. Understanding there is some macro uncertainty and potential headwinds from the rate outlook, we still expect to grow the franchise and we'll continue to strategically invest in our businesses in technology, bankers and beyond. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Questions and Answers
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on current loan growth, we feel very good about what we're seeing there. As we talked about at Investor Day, we have a real opportunity with our existing customers. And we talked about how our existing customers have about $250 billion of borrowing off us, about $100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback. So you can think of this as highly targeted to high-quality existing customers, and for the first time, we're actually seeing loan growth in Cards, the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers. And so we're really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at Investor Day.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So on the Mortgage business, I would say, it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously, highly rate dependent. But I would say the structural challenges in that business remain unchanged. And so we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity. And so looking at loan sales and thinking about derisking the portfolio from a servicing perspective. So good quarter on the back of the rally, but it doesn't change the overall structural challenges.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Okay. Sure. So first, I'll take you back to the first quarter, where our guidance was $58 billion plus and we talked about some pressure on the long end at that point. That pressure has persisted and, in fact, increased, and so we pulled the impact of the long end through in terms of our outlook. And then on the short end, the range of outcomes are obviously quite broad, and so we thought about a range of outcomes of 1 to 3 rate cuts. And so you can think about if it's 1 cut, $57.5 billion plus, and if it's more, $57.5 billion minus. And then based on current advice, you can think about the third quarter being $100 million to $150 million below the second quarter and then a bit more than that in the fourth quarter given we would have a full quarter at that point. Oh, and then in terms of betas, I mean largely speaking, you can think of betas as being symmetric, and so on the Consumer side, we saw little reprice on the way up, and so there is not a lot of opportunity on the way down. On the Wholesale side, if you look at large institutional businesses, like Treasury Services and Securities Services, we are largely at full reprice there, and so there should be opportunity there. And then in places like the Commercial Bank and Asset & Wealth Management, we are still ahead of what the model would have assumed, but we have started to see reprice tick up there. But importantly, I would say, we're not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we'll see how it goes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: And it's all embedded inâ€¦
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on the RWA side, yes, that is precisely why we are doing it, and so when you see the loan sales in Home Lending, yes they are offset in securities purchases, which are more efficient from a capital perspective as well as a liquidity perspective. So, yes. Having said that, on reserves, I mean, reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that because, of course, that will depend upon the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest and we've talked a lot about AI and machine learning. It's early innings there and there's a lot that we're going to be able to do assuming that's there and become more productive and then cloud -- developers can become more productive using the cloud.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So yes, there's a few things going on in loan growth, as you say, Glenn. So we have the loan sales, we also have the runoff of the tax-exempt portfolio. So you can think about loan growth probably closer to 4% if you adjust for those items. And importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that we're seeing in terms of the areas where we're investing. And then -- and for the full year, you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex CIB of 2% to 3% full year.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So as I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the Commercial Bank and AWM. We are still seeing some migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, but largely, we're seeing those balances stabilize. And then we do, of course, have continued growth in the Consumer Bank. And the second quarter is typically seasonally high in the Consumer Bank. So we have some growth in noninterest-bearing there. And even in the Consumer Bank, where we've seen growth decelerate, that's largely as a result of consumer spending. So that feels healthy as well.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes, it's probably more complicated, Glenn. And so just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are and, importantly, if we're looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about. So we're not going to give further guidance on 2020 until we know more.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: I would say that is firing on all cylinders. So it's brand, it's people, it's products. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy U.S. consumer as well and, in fact, retail sales this morning looked strong. So we can expect that to continue.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes, we have taken share in -- a little bit of share in Card. As you know, we're #1 in sales there. I think, importantly, what's helpful in Card is that we don't even need to take share to grow just given the secular tailwind that we have in the Card business on the electronification of cash.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: And we're taking share in merchant acquiring, yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So as we think about capital distribution first, we would start by always saying that we prefer to use our capital to invest and grow our businesses and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then to return excess capital to our shareholders. And so we are pleased with the approval and the additional capacity to return that $29.4 billion to shareholders. Having said that, we are still targeting the upper end of the 11% to 12% range. We're always going to want to have a management buffer because, as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses and then, of course, there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework. And then importantly, we wouldn't actually need to make that decision for a few more quarters, given the way the capital distribution plan is laid out over 4 quarters. But as of now, we are still targeting the upper end of 11% to 12%.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So it hasn't changed from Investor Day. Our range continues to be $4 billion to $6 billion, then we're prepared for the January 1 implementation.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: And don't forget, on credit cards, you get charge-back rights and you get the flows.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure, so the Chase offers, we talked about that at Investor Day. It's like a really powerful flywheel where we can -- we can deliver value to our large merchant clients in terms of being able to bring a very large customer base to them and then we can deliver that value to our customers at 0 cost to us. And so as I said in the presentation, we've had over 60 million Chase offers activated and so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers, but our large merchant clients and at 0 cost to us.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right, and you mentioned the 25% in LMI (inaudible) in terms of our branch footprint, in our expansion market, that's 30%.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet growth that you saw quarter-over-quarter, that was primarily related to our balance sheet and tens of businesses in Markets businesses. And then we were down on a spot basis quarter-over-quarter. But we start with deposit growth, and so we have had strong deposit growth, and so you see that reflected on the balance sheet side as well as you would have seen securities balances as well and some of that is adding duration and some of that is short-duration securities that are higher yielding than IOER, and yes, so.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right, the Street. I should have mentioned about home sales and home lending.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: We haven't disclosed the amounts of the gains and we had some loan sales in the fourth quarter, the first quarter and the second quarter. The first and second quarter, in terms of the notional amount, the first quarter was about $7 billion and the second quarter was about $9 billion, so just a little bit more.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So in terms of the Investment Banking pipeline, I'll just remind you that the third quarter is typically a seasonally lower quarter, and so sequentially, you should think about IB fees being down a bit. That said, the pipeline is healthy, although off a record performance last year, which is assumption of a reversion to more normal levels of activity as well as some overhang from macro uncertainty. In M&A, still feels very healthy and it's still a stage where companies are looking for synergistic opportunities for growth, especially in North America; perhaps Europe, a bit more muted. ECM, we had a very strong second quarter. So that will taper off in the second half a bit. But I would say deals are getting done well in the current environment. And then DCM, DCM will be more subdued reflecting a slowdown in acquisition financing activity as well as refinancing opportunities, but albeit with a good backdrop for new issuance given the rate environment.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So in terms of balance sheet management, we manage the balance sheet in both directions. It's a negatively convex balance sheet, and so all else being equal, as rates are declining, we would naturally drift shorter driven both by assets and liabilities. So you would expect us to add duration, which we did this quarter. But we're not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment. We're going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration. And then in terms of expenses, again, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of an interest rate environment. And I'll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here. And so if we end up with insurance cuts, it's a temporary headwind; and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about. But as Jamie always says, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of the macro environment. That said, in a broader slowdown, obviously, there are natural levers on our volume-related expenses and we redecision a large part of our investment portfolio on an annual basis. We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity depending upon the opportunity to take a look at that.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: I would say still to be determined. Our first choice will always be to use our excess capital to invest and grow our business, so still to be determined. And as you know, it's over 4 quarters, and so we have time to think about it, but obviously, we have the flexibility.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So the guidance we gave at Investor Day steady-state $58 billion to $60 billion, I would say, largely still stands. Importantly because when we talked about that at Investor Day, we weren't assuming any further benefit from rate. So we were assuming that any incremental increases in rates would be offset and repriced, and so the majority of that growth was going to come from balance sheet growth and mix. And if you remember the slides, there were a number of arrows on the slide. Even at that time, which was obviously a different rate environment, we were implying that there were a number of different paths to get there. And so that obviously continues to be true. And so there may be a different path to get there, it may take a little bit longer, but we still believe in that steady-state number because we still believe in the growth of the franchise.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: I was just going to say, we learned a lot in Finn. You said it, that we learned that importance of power to change brands certainly means that we don't need a separate brand. We also learned about a number of features that our customers love and we were able to reuse those features and port them over to the Chase mobile app. And so I think we always need to be testing and learning and doing things like this and not afraid to shut them down when we've learned what we needed to learn and can serve our customers through the primary Chase mobile app.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes, the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Thanks, everyone. Thanks, James.",0.31999999999999984,-0.5530000000000032,0,0.1233469855832241,0.13054234729419456
15,Q2_2018,"
MARIANNE LAKE, EXECUTIVE VP & CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion and EPS of $2.29 on revenue of $28.4 billion. All were records for second quarter, even excluding the benefit of tax reform. Our return on tangible common equity was 17%. And also included in the results were 2 notable items, which I will call out in a moment, excluding which EPS would have been about $0.10 higher. The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses, and highlights include average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year-on-year; Consumer deposit growth of 5%, which we believe continues to outpace the industry; Card sales up 11%; and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes each up 12%. We maintained our #1 rank in Global IB fees, and CIB delivered double-digit revenue growth across the board. Commercial Bank revenue was up 11% year-on-year, with IB revenues being a bright spot this quarter. And in Asset & Wealth Management, AUM and client assets were both up 8%. Turning to Page 2 for more details about the second quarter. The firm delivered strong core positive operating leverage this quarter. Revenue of $28.4 billion was up $1.7 billion or 6% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up over $600 million, driven by strong performance in Markets and IB fees and also higher Auto lease income. NIR this quarter was negatively impacted by a rewards liability adjustment in Card, and remember that last year included a significant legal benefit. Excluding these 2 items, NIR would have been up $1.6 billion and total revenue up 10%. Expense of $16 billion was up 8% year-on-year, with half of the increase directly related to incremental revenues, principally compensation in the CIB, transaction expenses and Auto lease growth. About 1/3 related to continued investments in technology as well as headcount across the businesses. And the remainder was largely a loss on the liquidation of a legacy legal entity as part of our simplification efforts. And if you exclude this item, expense was up only 7%. The legal entity loss together with the rewards liability adjustment in Card are the 2 notable items I mentioned at the beginning, for a total reduction of over $500 million pretax. Credit costs of $1.2 billion were flat year-on-year, and credit trends remain favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the second quarter with CET1 of 11.9%, up about 10 basis points versus the last quarter, as most of the capital generated was returned to shareholders. Risk-weighted assets were relatively flat despite solid growth in loans and commitments being offset across other categories. In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.6 billion of capital to shareholders. And last month, the Fed informed us that they did not object to our 2018 capital plan. We were pleased to announce gross repurchase capacity of nearly $21 billion over the next 4 quarters, and the board announced its intention to increase our common dividend to $0.80 per share, effective in the third quarter. Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $3.4 billion of net income and an ROE of 26%. Core loans were up 7% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending, up 12%; Business Banking, up 6%; Card, up 4%; and Auto loans and leases, also up 4%. Deposits grew 5%, and although growth is slower than a year ago, we are seeing record-high retention rates and customer satisfaction scores. Client investment assets were up 12%, with more than half of the growth from net new money flows, and we are capturing an outsized share as our customers shift from deposit to investments. Card sales volume was up 11%, and we announced several new cards as we continue to update our product offering. Revenue of $12.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was down 6% on production margin compression and lower net servicing revenue despite higher purchase volume in retail. And Card merchant services and Auto revenue was up 6%, driven by lower card acquisition costs, higher Card NII on margin expansion as well as loan growth as well as higher Auto lease volumes. This was largely offset by lower net interchange, driven by a rewards liability adjustment of about $330 million, reflecting strong customer engagement across our ultimate rewards offerings. As a result, the Card revenue rate was 10.4% for the quarter, but our full year guidance of approximately 11.25% holds. Expense of $6.9 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher Auto lease depreciation and investments in technology. Finally, on credit, charge-offs were down $36 million year-on-year, including a recovery of about $130 million from a loan sale in Home Lending. This was largely offset by higher net charge-offs in Card. The Card charge-off rate was 3.27%, reflecting seasonality and is in line with expectations and in line with our guidance. There were no reserve actions taken this quarter. Turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3.2 billion on revenue of $9.9 billion, up 11%, and an ROE of 17%. In banking, we maintained our #1 ranking for the quarter and year-to-date in Global IB fees, with a record first half performance, and we grew share across all regions. IB revenue of $1.9 billion was up 13% year-on-year, outperforming a market that was down slightly, as we saw robust activity particularly in M&A and ECM. It was a record second quarter for advisory fees, which were up 24%. Benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter, we gained share and ranked #2 globally. Equity underwriting fees were up 49%. We ranked #1 globally as well as in North America and EMEA and gained share in a competitive environment, driven by IPOs and convertibles in the 2 most active sectors, health care and technology, which are areas of strength for us. Additionally, we saw good momentum in private capital markets as clients are exploring alternative sources of capital. And debt underwriting fees were relatively flat versus a very strong prior year quarter, supported by healthy acquisition-related activity, and we ranked #1 in DCM globally and across all subproducts. Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong. Moving on to Markets. Total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance in FICC across categories and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 12%, adjusted, on the back of good client flow and decent volatility and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year. It was a record second quarter for equities, with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results and with particular strength in cash, prime and flow derivatives. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and Securities Services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels. Finally, expense of $5.4 billion was up 11%, driven by higher performance-related compensation, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%. Revenue was a record for a second quarter, up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and strong Investment Banking activity. Gross IB revenue of $739 million was up 39%, driven by several large transactions, a strong underlying flow of business and the overall pipeline is robust and active. Expense of $844 million was up 7% as we continue to invest in the business, both in bankers and in technology. Loan balances were up 4% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. C&I loans were up 3% year-on-year and sequentially due to increased M&A-related financing, with strength in our expansion markets as well as in specialized industries and despite lower tax-exempt activity. CRE loans were up 4% year-on-year and flat versus last quarter as there continues to be a lot of competition for high-quality assets and we are selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points. Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $755 million, with a pretax margin of 28% and an ROE of 33%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investments in advisers and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion, with positive flows across multi-asset, equities and alternatives, partially offset by outflows in fixed income. Additionally, we saw net liquidity flows -- inflows of $17 billion. AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were both up 8%, with the increase being split about equally between flows and higher market levels globally. Deposits were down 7% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investments, where we are also capturing the vast majority, and down 3% sequentially on seasonal tax payments. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 12%, with strength in global Wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $136 million. The result included a pretax $174 million loss on the liquidation of a legacy legal entity previously mentioned. But it is of note that while this loss through expense affects retained earnings this quarter, it is offset from a capital perspective. So it's capital-neutral. Before I wrap up, you may note we have no outlook page here. Although both revenue and expense are trending higher, market related, given we're only halfway through the year, we are not updating our outlook at this point. So to close, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be supportive. Consumer and business confidence and sentiment remains high. Client activity levels are robust, and the markets are open and active. We are pleased with the funds results this quarter. Our broad-based financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform. Revenue grew strongly, double digits year-over-year in many cases. We realized positive core operating leverage despite significant investments. And credit trends remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. This was a clear record for a second quarter whichever way you slice it. We remain focused on consistently delivering for our customers and our communities and investing for the long term. With that, operator, can you open up the line to Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: So I'll start at the end because that's pretty simple. It obviously affected the Card revenue rate in the quarter. You can see that, that was 10.4%, and you can see on the page we've adjusted for the impact. But the 11.25% for the year remains true, which is to say that while this may be slightly larger than normal, it's not exactly a onetime item. We regularly review our liability as we observe the mix of our portfolio and the behaviors of our customers. On face value, I know rewards is often talked about as a competitive matter. I mean, this is less about competition per se. In fact, we have record-low sales attrition, which, in a competitive environment, is really very good. And it's more about a customer's awareness of the value proposition of rewards and them being engaged in redeeming them, which, for us, is net a positive thing because engaged customers spend more and we're seeing that -- they attrite less, and we're seeing that. And they will bring us more of their share of deposits and investments as we deepen relationships. So I would say it's a little larger than normal. We do it pretty regularly, so it's not onetime, but it's not completely typical.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. I think it's -- I mean, it's pretty global across all businesses as a general matter. I mean, there are some obvious areas where it's pretty acute. In the retail auto space, for example; we talked about Commercial Real Estate, for example; mortgage, clearly with capacity in the system, for example, all of those areas are pretty competitive for a variety of reasons, given where we are on the cycle, in the economy and the like. But I would say it's broad-based. It's everywhere. That said, we are holding our own and, in many cases, gaining share, so we're doing pretty well.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I would say -- you talked Consumer deposit, so I'm now -- I'm talking retail now, not the sort of high-net-worth base. I'll come back to that. Consumer deposit is up 5% year-on-year, slowing down, as we would have expected. While you have seen online competitors and even some regional competitors make some moves in the large bank space, we haven't really seen that yet. When we look at the sort of deposit slowdown and we unpack it, it feels to us like the vast majority of the root cause is customers moving into investments and, in the case of retail customers, actually into managed accounts, so it doesn't even appear to be rate-seeking. Spending more would be the second driver. And to a much lesser extent, we're seeing behaviors that look like they're rate-seeking at this point. So we're not seeing that kind of migration out of the company to online or other competitors at this point. And so at this point, reprice is still not happening. That said, we are on a journey clearly. In the high net worth space, we continue to see the migration into investment assets we've been seeing. And again, we continue to recapture the vast majority of those. So at this point, things are playing out as we would have expected, and we're not actually losing deposits en masse to any third parties.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would look at Finn as one of many sort of digital innovations that we're doing. And I would look at it also in conjunction with broader digital account opening. And although we have now launched Finn nationwide, I think it's fair to say it's still very nascent, and we're still learning. So we're going to continue to observe. It's got very high Net Promoter Score, by the way, so customer experience is good, but it's still quite young.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, we just started. I would say digital account opening, on the other hand, is a pretty good success story. And we are seeing a lot more accounts opened digitally across the channels, and we're seeing, of those, a decent chunk of net new to the bank. And where we're seeing existing customers open new accounts, we're getting incremental money. So we are seeing our digital effort pay off. And even more broadly than that, we could go into QuickPay and Zelle and the like. But I wouldn't focus overly on Finn as -- and I'd say to think digital more broadly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I would say that -- we would -- it is -- the Commercial Bank C&I loans is a kind of bellwether. There has been decent demand. And I mentioned it in my remarks, but decent demand, not exclusively but partially on the back of a very robust and active M&A environment. And so the demand is there. I would say growth is solid and in line with our expectations. We will continue to hope to see that growth as we go through the year. And there may up -- and there may be other tailwinds. We've yet to see the full effect of tax reform flow through into profitability and free cash flow. So I would categorize loan growth as solid, and our expectation is for the outlook to remain solid, benefiting from a very active capital markets environment.
MARIANNE LAKE: I mean, we are -- we're at -- Fed funds are 175 to 200 right now, so we're not anywhere yet close to normal rates. And so when we think about what we've talked about normalizing NIM, we're thinking about it more through the cycle, adjusted for new liquidity rules and everything else. So we have a number of further rate hikes to go before we reach that point. But we are, on a core basis -- and remember, we have a fairly sizable market balance sheet, but on the core basis, we are continuing to see NIM expansion in line with expectations and moving up towards that. So we would expect to see expansion year-over-year, moving towards that level but not getting there yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say, on the comment period for the SEB, obviously, during the comment period, the regulators are quiet, so it wasn't a 2-way dialogue during that period. We would expect the 2-way dialogue to start now that the comment period is over and the industry -- and bilateral letters have been submitted. I will say, going back to comments I think I've made previously, that I remain constructive about the willingness for the current leadership to pay attention and take on board those comments. And if you look at the proposal that was sent out for comment, not only did it have a large number of questions that they were asking for feedback on, but the actual proposal was very similar to what we had been understanding was the intention in speeches that go back a fair way, which is to say that it feels like we're still making the sausage rather than this is a done deal. And so we're very optimistic that the comments will be taken on board, and you know what they are. Volatility was evident in spades in this test, opaqueness, G-SIB. We can go through them. I'm sure we will. So we remain optimistic that the comments -- sorry, the bilateral discussions will start now. I would say -- or the industry-wide discussions will start now. I would say, on CCAR, it felt status quo to prior years. It is not to say that it's not constructive. It's just it didn't -- it felt like there is a growth bias.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean, I would say 2 things, which is, while this cycle is older than, essentially, typically cycles had been, growth over the last decade has been lower through the recovery. So there is plenty, potentially, of room to play. And as we look at all the economic data, not just here in the U.S. but also globally, there are no real signs of fragility. And I know people are staring at a flat yield curve, and we would say that, that flat yield curve is a bear flattening, good flattening from bank profitability perspective and not some looming risk of a recession embedded in it, so on premium, still negative; real policy rates, still at 0; credit, very benign. That said, we are in cyclical businesses, no doubt. And so we are preparing, and we will be ready when the cycle turns. And no doubt, there will be impact from that. But through the cycle, I think we've proven that our business model will produce strong shareholder returns and among best-in-class performance.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. I would also say that the shape of the curve is correlated to Fed funds in a tightening cycle. And that is what we're seeing. So while there are other factors weighing potentially on the 10-year in terms of still very accommodative central bank policy, particularly in the Bank of Japan and the ECB, obviously, trade is not necessarily constructed just in terms of a narrative for short-term underfunded pensions going into bonds. There are some technicals, but fundamentally, what you're seeing in terms of the flattening is pretty typical of a tightening cycle. And as long as it's accompanied with solid to strong economic growth, it doesn't concern us at this point. And in fact, as we've been pointing out, we are still levered towards front-end rates from a profitability perspective, and we do expect the curve to steepen over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say just a tiny little correction. Our outlook was 6% to 7% core loan growth excluding the CIB. We're at 7% now. Things are still moving ahead in line with that. I would also just point out that it is an outlook, not a target. So while we still feel like that is our outlook at this point, we obviously are going to make the right decisions based upon the environment that we're in. Competitively, the private credit market for Commercial Real Estate, for leverage lending is competitive. But so are -- there are also the mainstream competitors. So it's just that the environment is pretty constructive and everybody is trying to get to -- access to the high-quality assets. And so margins are under pressure. And we will make sure we're getting the right returns for the risk we're taking.
MARIANNE LAKE: There's a couple of things. The $62 billion -- remember, the $62 billion was before the impact of expense gross-up. So the actual full year outlook was $63 billion -- about $63 billion, including them. This obviously. So it was in our number, but you can't annualize it. You can't sort of times it by 4. So you're absolutely right, as you look out for the full year, to the degree that we would be above our outlook of $63 billion, it will be largely driven, if not exclusively driven, by higher performance-related compensation on higher revenues, with the only other caveat that, as you probably know, we are waiting, as I'm sure you are, for when the FDIC surcharge is taken away. The FDIC anticipated that would be in the middle of the year this year, but that is now potentially at some risk to moving out into the third or fourth quarter. So while that could have an impact on this year, to answer your broader question of are we still on track for our expense overhead ratios, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say, so far, where we are is that trade is firmly part of the risk narrative. So it's definitely, as Jamie said, on the psyche of people, but it is not, at this point, causing them to change the strategic actions and decisions that they're making, but clearly part of the conversation. And as currently outlined, it's more of that than it is a real impact to sort of the global macroeconomic outlook. But that isn't to say that uncertainty can't ultimately lead to more challenges or slower growth because confidence is a really important part of not just the business investment cycle but also the financial market stability. So at this point, it's more of a risk narrative than it is an actual driver, but it is important that, that uncertainty is taken off the table.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I'm going to say yes, in a nutshell, it got better. But let me just give you the context. The context is, as you will recall, as we ended the first quarter, there were some bouts of volatility and clients became more cautious, and that carried over into the first half of this quarter. And so while activity was fine, it wasn't as strong. In the second half of the quarter, that generally faded. Activity levels picked up, and I would say there were more catalysts. And ironically, one of the more catalysts, when you're thinking about -- trading volatility or intraday volatility or volleyball trade is part of that. Emerging market idiosyncratic events are part of that, the European sovereign [SLE] situation. So there's just more catalysts in the market and, just generally, more client participation.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry, just to finish that to make sure that no one is confused. It was pretty broad-based. It was pretty consistent throughout the second half of the quarter, and it wasn't a lot of one-off large trades.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well -- so the Fed has been on a pretty well-telegraphed path reducing their balance sheet by about $50 billion a quarter. We talked about the fact that if you take $1.5 trillion out of the system, if you look at -as the Fed has grown its balance sheet, about half of that will ultimately impact deposits, and our share of it would be 10%. So we talked about, potentially, that kind of $50 billion to $75 billion of deposit outflows over the several years it would take to reduce that. But primarily, they would be, not exclusively but primarily, nonoperating and therefore, limited impact on liquidity basis. And so it's playing out textbook right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: So residential mortgage correspond -- in particular is pricing, pricing, pricing. And so we will see share if the pricing goes to what we would consider to be not sufficient to return shareholder value. In the Commercial Real Estate space, I would say it is primarily pricing, so spreads are under a lot of pressure. And the companies that I've heard, it's GSEs, it's insurance companies, it's nonbank financial institutions. It's a little bit less credit turns, but still pretty robust, albeit there's -- we are seeing a tiny shift to the right in LTVs. We're not going there, by the way, but I would call it pretty modest. So I would say, generally, turns are holding up quite well.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm really -- Al, I'm sorry...
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry, Al. I'm really, really sorry, but we -- actually, you were breaking up, and so I didn't catch most of that question.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I would say across regions. Equities, strong performance across regions. While there were more catalysts this quarter, so you've mentioned Italy, I think, none of those were particular drivers. So we did fine on all of those as well, as I mentioned. So I would say broad-based, gaining share, we think, in some areas in equities, cash and prime in particular and holding our own elsewhere, and I would say solid performance across the FICC spectrum.
MARIANNE LAKE: And Investment Banking. Yes, gaining share in Investment Banking, but obviously, you can't look at any one quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, I mean, I would say that if you look back over the course of the last couple of years, you have seen some share shift from European banks to U.S. banks broadly. In the prime space, I would say U.S. prime incumbents are gaining some share. But it's not a particularly new trend, and it's not the dominant trend.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So linked-quarter reported, down 2 basis points because of low Markets NII and higher Markets assets of $20 billion; core, up 8 basis points.
MARIANNE LAKE: Charge-offs. So in CIB, the charge-offs were driven by 2 names, and the principal one was the remaining piece of the Steinhoff loan that we sold this quarter. We had a reserve release against it that was larger.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we haven't disclosed that, but if you look at our historical pattern, it's pretty even.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sure. Well, I mean, look, CECL is not a big deal insofar as we're getting ready for it. I will tell you that we haven't disclosed an adjustment number on the basis that we're still working through the modeling and the data. And it is more complicated perhaps operationally to get everything lined up than you might think. We're going to intend to be running some stuff in parallel next year, so we'll be able to give you much more color next year. Generally speaking, as you move to life of loan losses, it won't shock you to know that we will have an adjustment to our reserves through equity. It will be driven most likely by any of the portfolios that have longer weighted average life versus incurred loss models. Card would be the most notable; to a lesser extent, unfunded wholesale commitments. But it will be manageable in the context of the firm. It goes through equity. And then if you think about the economics, the cash flows, the NPV of these loans doesn't change.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. It doesn't change the economics of the loans. You upfront a little bit of reserves you get paid for over time. We don't think it's going to fundamentally shift the dynamics, but that will play out.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's hard because it's life of loan, so it's hard to have a shorter -- it's difficult to imagine that a life of loan could be shorter that an incurred loss, so no, not really. But for us, the reason why it's pretty limited -not to say there's no other impact, but the reason why it will be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because, in most of our wholesale spaces and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not total life of loan, at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm not sure that I totally follow the question. I just...
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. And remember that in a very, very oversimplified model of the universe, we would want an extraordinarily high level of redemption. We are giving these rewards to customers because we think that they are, and they indeed are, perceiving great value in them. And so we're just continuing to observe that as the mix changes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you very much, you guys.
MARIANNE LAKE: Bye-bye.",0.06999999999999984,0.33200000000000185,1,0.09251790873806445,0.11961462444293769
16,Q3_2012,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: The only thing I want to say about capital, the 8.4% Basel III, which obviously is an estimate, up front phases in everything that we know of today. It does not phase in what we know about our own run off and the ability to create new models down the road to reduce it. So we would estimate if you did all that, we are close to 9.5%.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't know. They will let us know. Remember, this only affects the first-quarter buyback, which is not that substantial for our Company and we have to reapply for the full year CCAR, which would affect what we can do after March 31, which we will be doing soon. That's the more important number.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't know there's going to be a quote collateral shortfall. It's not quite clear yet and the rules for collateral -- the liquidity stuff is not quite clear yet. Clearing houses, they are both an opportunity and a risk and so we hope to get -- we are building the systems so we can provide cross collateral for clients and ease of transaction and cheap transactions for clients. Obviously it may change some of the volume that goes to other things. But I'm not sure in total that that's going to change a lot the FICC line. Our experience has been as things go to clearing houses or electronic execution, sometimes volume goes up and makes up for it.
JAMIE DIMON: You basically laid it all out already, which is lower rates hurts you a little bit. They obviously help mortgage origination and ultimately housing prices, because low rates could drive that part of the economy a little bit. If it were to drive the economy and I'm not sure it will, that would be a plus for us. So I think they're doing their job not to help banks or hurt banks but to try to drive the economy and drive jobs. If that works, it's a good plus. I personally think that fiscal policy is going to be more important than the Fed policy soon. The Fed needs help with rational fiscal policy.
JAMIE DIMON: Not a lot. If you look at -- the margins in production are very high. They're well over like 2% and a norm would be under 1%. So obviously one day that will normalize. In the meantime, you get volume and higher spreads. On the other hand, we have huge excess servicing costs which probably would more than offset that and when housing recovers, charges will come down. So to me if the economy gets better, we are fine. You lose some production income but everything else will be better.
JAMIE DIMON: The big one to look at is the excess servicing costs due to the high level defaults and the high cost defaults and the consent orders and look at that number as about $500 million a quarter, it's a little more than that. That number will eventually be zero. But I don't think it's going round to zero. It will probably take eight quarters before it goes down to a number approaching zero. Maybe more. It's going to take a while to work through all of that but that number will disappear. Production income will also come down at one point for all the reasons you said. When rates go back up, you're not going to have all the refis we have today and you'll probably have more competition on purchase money originations reducing margins and obviously when the housing recovers, the losses we are bearing on charge offs will reduce too on just owning the real estate portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: I would expect none next quarter. I would expect a little bit in 2013 and a lot in 2014. But those are just -- those are just rough estimates. We don't really know.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think you are separating. When we talk about mortgage, the private label stuff, we said we thought were substantially and fairly well gone but there is other mortgage stuff that goes in and out and we adjust for. And there's constant other litigation. So when we can -- when we know we have something we can estimate what it is, we put up litigation reserves for it. Unfortunately I think litigation costs will stay high for a while too. They are just constant development of litigation. It's not all mortgage-related.
JAMIE DIMON: Listen, look, it's obvious that we had a gap in the armor here, like I say, an arrow went right through that gap. But other than that gap we think we have pretty damn good controls in stuff like that. That material weakness will be fixed. We have huge -- we've got a great Company. We've got huge cash flows, huge capability and we could probably buy back a lot of stock next year and still hit the 9.5% Basel III at one point. And so I think a rational thing to do is if the stock is at the right price to buy back stock. Obviously we are going to apply and we don't know -- the CCAR rules will change next year so when we see those rules, we will decide.
JAMIE DIMON: I would hope not. I would hope that when you look at the Company in total you see pretty good disciplines and pretty good controls.
JAMIE DIMON: Obviously, I find it hugely irritating that people yapped to the press like that, but Doug is a top professional. He ran our US investment bank coverage for many years. He has been a top CFO and we have no -- we will let you know when and if we intend to make changes when we make them not through gossip in the press. I should point out we have a very strong bench in this Company. We've got a lot of talented people so if and when we make a decision like that, we will make it. I also want to point out, we always have conversations with senior people and everybody about the future for them, their career, what they want to do next when the timing makes sense for them in the Company. That's kind of a normal conversation. I wouldn't put that as an abnormal type of conversation.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not sure it creates an issue for the lawsuit but I agree with you as a policy matter, it's going to make it much harder in the future for companies to buy a troubled company.
JAMIE DIMON: I also want to mention when the government bankrupted GM, you do remember they did bankrupt GM, they absolved GM of all private legal liability, so the government is being a little inconsistent here.
JAMIE DIMON: So when I made comment publicly at another forum that when we did Bear Stearns, remember we put substantial reserves in purchase accounting so it didn't run through the P&L for close down costs, litigation, consolidation, and materially risk management, like to get down the risk that we got in Bear Stearns. So it including that number, was the [work] we put in purchase accounting. Since then, we've put up more reserves for mortgage-related stuff somewhat related to Bear Stearns, somewhat related to WaMu, some were related to JP Morgan Chase itself and so it's increased the cost to us. That's unfortunate but that is life and we've reserved for the things we know about and we think about now that we --. So it is in our numbers, the comments I'm making, we are not future-looking additional reserves.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, the losses there are very low and you really should not expect much improvement from here. They are historical lows and --. But what we are really proud of in the card businesses is that these new products, Sapphire, Freedom, [Inc]., products like blueprint or rewards programs, are doing well. We've been gaining share every single year for four years now in card. And you see it in the spend numbers not in the outstanding numbers but in the spend. So spend was up like 11%. If you compare that to a lot of competitors, it's more than double the growth of the average competitor and that's obviously driving revenues. We also have a merchant processor in there which I think if I remember correctly grew 18%. That's in the revenue line so the card business has been doing very well. They're finally making up the years that they didn't do very well.
JAMIE DIMON: Marketing with high last quarter and normal this quarter is the way I'd look at it. But marketing to me is an investment in the future, so if we come up with plans and marketing plans we think are going to have very good returns, we are going to spend the money. That's what we do. We don't sit here and set a marketing budget and meet it. We actually try to review all of the programs we have and when we have attractive things to do, we're going to do them even if it reduces the current quarter profits.
JAMIE DIMON: Can you repeat the question again?
JAMIE DIMON: Mortgage is high. Mortgage is high. Appraisal standards are too high. The verification income is extreme and since we don't know the rules of securitizations in QRM, I think it's going to loosen over time. I think doing mortgages today, you get very good credits, very good underlying collateral. Remember a lot of credits can't get loans today. It will loosen over time. And I think you just need a stronger economy and some decisions with some of these regulatory rules or even some of the Basel rules could create kind of cliffs in mortgages so the risk-weighted assets -- I think if you go below 680 FICO, it dramatically jumps. There's huge incentive not to do any mortgage below 680. And so I think some of those things hopefully will be sorted out in the next six months or nine months. And credit card, auto, student, and other, I don't think you should expect to see major changes.
JAMIE DIMON: We are doing budgets now and we are always going to drive efficiency and expenses. And our expenses, what I like about our expenses is in those numbers is constant investment. And you see that, more bankers, more branches, more systems, more countries, more -- that is what's important for driving the future of the Company. So obviously some expenses will be going up because they are good expenses and the bad -- some expenses coming down as we become more efficient and we're always trying to drive down what I call bad expenses -expenses driven by bureaucracy, stupidity, and stuff like that. So we're going to try to -- we will fine tune it and when we have Investor Day next year, we will probably give you a better outlook for what we expect. But right now an expectation would be kind of level plus what we can save to offset the investments.
JAMIE DIMON: So in servicing, it's $500 million a quarter which will eventually go to zero and the real driver of that is things in default, delinquency or foreclosure. As those things come down, you're going to see those costs come down. Second, we have to finish the consent order and that but I think they are all kind of related. In real estate, home prices going up will reduce real estate losses. Jobs will reduce real estate losses. The number of homes under water is 2 million less now than it was like a year ago so obviously those things will all be pluses. I think you just need a good economy and you will see charge-offs start to come down more -- faster than they have been coming down recently.
JAMIE DIMON: Can you turn up your mic, Doug. I can't hear you Doug.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, we got you.
JAMIE DIMON: It could be, because the implied curve has pushed lower rates out much longer, so the depression could go on for a little bit longer than we would have thought before. But Mike, remember that that also relates to decisions we are going to make, how long the duration of our portfolio is, what we do in making loans, how we want to manage the risk-weighted assets. There's been a lot of changes in the business. We've got to adjust to those changes.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say competitive but not necessarily more competitive, so we try to stay competitive in most pricing. Get under -- do the credit right and be competitive on price is more important than being competitive in pricing but -- don't be competitive in pricing but have bad underlying credit standards.
JAMIE DIMON: On jumbo loans, we did a little bit. Most of the loans probably not.
JAMIE DIMON: Actually inn jumbo, I would say we actually we just reduced rates to meet the market. We were probably a little high.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not going to price a lot lower to create demand or something like that. I think it's a little elastic. We see the elastic in jumbo. We're not going to change our underwriting standards in card. We're not going to change our underrating standards in pricing. We got a little more competitive in auto but again that's just following the business. The business, these are competitive businesses and we have to compete. We have to decide whether we are going to meet lower prices or not so in auto and home -- and jumbo we did. I would say in the commercial corporate side, probably not much.
JAMIE DIMON: I think as long as rates stay low, refis will stay high and volume would be high and very high-volume clogs up the system and allows higher pricing. I think that once you start to see rates go up, which personally I think will probably happen sometime in 2013, but I don't know that, you're going to see lower refi and more competitive pricing, more home purchase but more competitive pricing. So you can't -- we don't expect to count on the high margins and mortgage origination forever. Maybe you're going to have it -- you're going to have it next quarter maybe for a couple of quarters after that but it won't last for that much longer.
JAMIE DIMON: When you talk about the fourth quarter, I don't -- as you look at the commercial bank, you can pretty much project the results for next quarter. So the fiscal cliff isn't going to change us. It's NII from loans in the books and from treasury deposits and things like that. The investment bank would be more sensitive to what the market reacts to if they get very scared about the fiscal cliff, but I just don't -- we just don't know. We're going to be prepared. JPMorgan will try to be there for its clients regardless and I'm not just going to drive the fourth-quarter results that much. I think the only place you will see it really drive it would be in the investment bank if volume had dropped dramatically. But I can give you arguments why fiscal cliff could drive volumes up in the short run.
JAMIE DIMON: The increase is mostly from the reduction in short positions out of the synthetic credit portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: The rest is kind of business as usual in Italy and Spain. We are still doing business there. You should expect to see that exposure go up a little bit from here, too.
JAMIE DIMON: First, we don't have the final CCAR rules yet and they're going to change some of them and we've got to see that before we see it. We are also working through all the new RWA rules, the Basel II.5, the NPR, Basel III and all the new liquidity rules LCR. We are going to get it all right and then we are going to apply. I think we will be able to buy back a substantial amount of stock and meet the 9.5% Basel III in 2013, by late 2013. But I can't give you the number right now. There may be more or less than last year what we applied for.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I think -- we did shrink it. I've got the number 2500 down to 700 or 800 more looking at the complete relationship in correspondent but the correspondent side, I think it is a pure economic transaction. Other people get out of the business and we probably just end up with a little bit more share for that region. It's not a big strategic thrust. If the mortgage folks come in and say that they can generate a lot of servicing in a very economic rate and do more, we would do more.
JAMIE DIMON: We haven't disclosed anything or -- but I would expect that when these things come out everyone's going to have to do -- have something of the same order just in the ordinary course of business. It's unlikely that you have one -- three people get it and not the fourth.
JAMIE DIMON: Conforming loans, you sell them. That's fine. You meet their standards. What I was referring to is that some of the new Basel rules create these little cliffs on risk-weighted assets and if I remember correctly, one of the cliffs that's created when you go post 700 or 680 or 650 and that therefore you are going to -- it's going to be harder for certain people to own mortgages even if they are very well underwritten -- even 60% loan-to-value is below 680 because of the high risk-weighted capital charge. I think some of that is stifling mortgage originations to those folks. That's what I'm saying and I think it should loosen up over time and I'm not sure the regulators intended that when they put up the new Basel rules.
JAMIE DIMON: We've always said 35% to 40%. We actually use a formula which uses returns on capital and the type of revenues and the type of profits, etc. risk-adjusted and all that. So that's the numbers that generally go through. But as a rule of thumb, I would think about 35% being a good number.
JAMIE DIMON: Obviously every year it changes and competition changes and whether you're investing in certain parts of the world, you may fund that separately because you can't take that out of -- current people working hard today to fund a big investment in another part of the world. So it will change over time, but 35%. If you look at our investment bank, 35% comp I think it's like 25% non-comp, which means we have a 40% margin. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. If we can sustain that, I would be a very happy guy in a competitive environment.
JAMIE DIMON: I think I was referring to that -- I was asked a question in the Council of Foreign Relations about the Eurozone crisis and the fiscal cliff. We do have a kind of war room Eurozone crisis. We've done extensive work on it. I also mentioned we'd probably spent $50 million or so getting prepared for the debt crisis that we had nine months ago or so. And we are preparing -- I wouldn't call it a war room, you misstated it, we are -- we've got to get prepared for the fiscal cliff. What does it mean? Maybe not so much for us but for our clients, how are they going to react? What do we have to be prepared to do? Unfortunately when things like a fiscal -- if the fiscal actually happens, you have to be prepared for various scenarios including the worst possible one even if you don't predict it. So that's what we are really thinking. What could really happen? What are we missing? How bad could it be? We have got to be prepared for it. We are hoping it doesn't happen.
JAMIE DIMON: So last time we gave you some measures, CSO ones, VAR, RWA and a couple of stress tests, we said extreme stress, $800 million to $1.6 billion. That was July 13. Almost any measure you look at of risk would be down 20%, 30%, or 40%. So certain risks are down 40%, certain risks down 30%, certain 20% and the stress risk in addition to down by that amount, the folks are doing a great job managing it. They had a modest loss this quarter. We feel completely comfortable with it. It obviously can lose money, can also make money and we always said we hope by the end of the year it's a nonissue and we don't have to talk about it anymore. We're still on track for that.
JAMIE DIMON: The folks are doing a great job hedging every conceivable piece of it they know about, while conducting client business.
JAMIE DIMON: You know, in the last couple months they have made I would say a lot of progress if you look at the OMT even though it has conditions but it is a big statement to make sovereign debt good for Italy and Spain. The conversations about the banking union and guaranteed programs which would protect from a run in the banks in Spain and Italy and also trying to redo this fiscal which would take years with the fiscal agreement among the Eurozone nation. So I think they've made a lot of progress. You see it reflected in bond rates. I still think it's going to be a roller coaster. There will be ups and downs as things -- good things happen or bad things happen. They are only in a mild recession. I think that's a very good thing and we have always made a decision to continue to conduct business in France and Germany and the UK and Spain and Italy. So we continue to be worried about it. We're going to be prepared for bad outcomes but we are there and if there are opportunities -- we haven't seen -- unbelievable opportunities like asset sales or something like that, we will participate. If they are assets we want or things we want to do.
JAMIE DIMON: I hope so, but we aren't running the Company guessing on things like that. We run the Company trying to build our client business and I hope so. I hope they continue to make progress. The tone is good. We are prepared for if that's not true, too.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm just surprised no one mentioned how handsome Doug Braunstein looked in the article in The Wall Street Journal.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you, folks. I'll talk to you.",0.23,0.2829999999999992,1,0.09820224781831924,0.13242311888245625
17,Q3_2013,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. The firm made a net loss of $380 million for the third quarter, on the back of very significant litigation expenses, so I want to take you first to page 2. We've added this page for this quarter only as we want to be as transparent with you as we can be, and give you as complete a picture as possible of our litigation reserves, and a current perspective on the evolution of our reasonably possible range of losses in litigation. And as you know, as transparent as we would like to be, we are necessarily constrained in what we can actually say. Having said that on page 2, I'll start by saying that we appreciate the litigation expense of $9.2 billion is much more significant than you've been expecting. It's much more significant than we expected, until very recently. The reality is that over the last few weeks, the environment has become highly charged and very volatile. Things have been very fluid, and the situation escalated to the point where we're facing very large premiums and penalties, the level of which has gone far beyond what we reasonably expected; however, those are the facts we're dealing with today in our reserving actions this quarter and are trying as far as possible to put these issues behind us. So let me quickly take you through the table on the top of page 2, which is a roll forward of our reserves. We started 2010 with $3 billion in reserves, added around $28 billion through the third quarter, including the actions this period, and have settled a little less than $8 billion across matters, which leaves us with $23 billion approximately of ending reserves, which relates to a broad range of matters, and includes a significant reserve for mortgage-related matters, including both securities and repurchase litigation exposure. Remember our GSE repurchase reserves of over $2 billion are separate from this. The balance at quarter-end reflects the $9.2 billion we're expensing this quarter. This expense also covers a range of matters, including but not limited to mortgage backed securities. And the impact to net income you can see is high, as it's being affected by a portion of the expense estimated to relate to enforcement penalties, which would not be tax deductible. Again, these estimates relate to a number of cases, including among other things, mortgage, as well as the recently-announced CIO settlements. We do expect litigation expenses to normalize over time to much lower levels, but they may be somewhat lumpy quarter over quarter. Finally on this page, we've included a table, which shows a revised range of reasonably possible losses, and those are losses that would be in addition to our reserves, and remember, it's pretax. It's very important to emphasize that when estimating this range, it's difficult, and there are significant inherent uncertainties and judgment required. As you can see, this was estimated at $6.8 billion last quarter, and while the range has gone down versus last quarter, its only gone down modestly in comparison to the reserve adds. Think of it simply as the estimate of what was reasonably possible back in the second quarter reflected our best assessment of the environment we were in, and our best judgment at that time. But as I said, we didn't, even a few weeks ago, reasonably expect things to have escalated to where they are now, so we have therefore revised our range to better reflect the reality of this current environment, with a range of up to $5.7 billion. Before we go back to page 1, just a final comment, as we said in the press release, the Board and senior management continues to seek fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage related issues, but at this time, we're unable to report on any specifics. So just flipping back to page 1, and just to finish off the front page, the other significant item we've highlighted on the page is the combined $1.6 billion of loan loss reserve releases for the consumer businesses, and if you add the two significant items in the table, which we don't consider to be core to our earnings, they total a loss of $6.2 billion, and $1.59 of EPS to the negative. If you adjust our results for these two non-core items, we would have earned $5.8 billion and an EPS of $1.42 with a return on tangible common equity of 15%, and that's not to discount the items, but rather to show the strength of our underlying performance. The businesses showed double-digit growth in key drivers, as well as market share gains in consumer and CIB, in banking and market. For the second consecutive year, we lead the nation in deposit growth, up 10%, credit card sales volumes were up 11%, and we maintained our number one IDC ranking, with 130 basis points increase in market share, and asset management saw $19 billion of long term net inflows, the 18th consecutive quarter. So turning with that to page 4 and the detail of our balance sheet and capital. First, after allowing for dividends and repurchases, our capital declined in the quarter by approximately $2 billion. As a result, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio remained flat at 9.3% quarter over quarter, with a decline in capital being offset by lower risk-weighted assets, primarily driven by legacy portfolio run-off. We're targeting 9.5% by the end of this year, and still aiming to run at about a 50 to 100 basis point buffer above this level over time, and our 2014 CCAR submission will take both these targets into consideration, as well as maintaining the flexibility to increase dividends and to repurchase shares. And just a note, our Basel III ratio under the advanced approach is currently lower than under the standardized approach. An update then on leverage. The firm-wide supplementary leverage ratio under US rules remains at 4.7% this quarter, and similarly, the bank leverage ratio remains at 4.3%. And as you know, comment letters were provided recently relating to both the US NPR as well as Basel proposals, which included requests for revised treatment for certain assets and exposures, and we don't know what the outcome of the final rules will be, but it's possible there will be some things to improve those numbers. Finally, we remain compliant with LCR this quarter, and have HQLA of over $530 billion, with around $350 billion in cash at central banks. And as you know, we resubmitted our CCAR at the end of September, and expect to receive feedback from the Fed in early December. So now let's turn to business performance, and while the environment has been and continues to be very challenging, remember that there are more than 250,000 people in this Company focused day-in and day-out on serving our customers and communities. So with that on page 5 I'll start with Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.7 billion in net income for the quarter, on $11 billion of revenue, and with an ROE of 23%. As expected, we've seen a sharp drop in mortgage banking origination volumes and margins that's impacted noninterest revenue in the quarter. But taking a look at the franchise, we ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs, and 1,900 Chase Private Client locations. And we continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers for the consumer businesses. Average deposits were up $40 billion year on year, an increase of 10% and for the second year in a row, we lead the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth, and a growth rate more than twice the industry average, with that strength being broad based across markets. We're number one in our three largest markets and we gained share in 20 of the 25 largest markets. Our active mobile customer base grew by 30% year on year. We had record credit card sales volume of $107 billion, up 11% year on year, and outperforming the industry for the fifth consecutive year. This quarter also had record client investment assets of $179 billion, up 16% year on year, reflecting strong positive momentum of the Chase Private Client initiative, as well as overall higher market levels. And to close a moment on expenses, which were down $89 million year on year primarily due to lower mortgage banking expenses, and across CCB, we will have reduced headcount by over 15,000 for the full year of 2013. Turning to page 6, consumer and business banking. Generated net income of $762 million, and an ROE of 27% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 2% year on year, and 3% quarter on quarter. Net interest income is up 3% quarter on quarter, driven by the strong growth in deposits I mentioned, partially offset by spread compression. But for the first time in about three years, the deposit margin has not declined quarter over quarter, meaning that rate compression is being offset by higher reinvestment rates. And at current market rates we would expect, all other things being equal, for our deposit margin to be relatively stable in the medium term. On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue. Expenses are up year on year, reflecting the investments we've made in the business, including Chase Private Client, as well as costs related to strengthening control and compliance. In a minute on business banking, you can see loan balances are flat quarter over quarter, up 2% versus last year, and production levels have stabilized at around these levels with a healthy pipeline in that context. Turning to page 7 and the mortgage bank. Overall mortgage banking net income was around $700 million, with an ROE of 14%. And the short story here is significantly lower production income offsetting higher reserve releases, but if you start at the top with production pretax, we guided you that production pretax margins would be slightly negative in each of the third and fourth quarters. Excluding repurchases, you can see that's the case for the third quarter, with a net loss of $85 million or a net negative 21 basis points of pretax margin. As you see, revenues are down over 50% quarter on quarter. This reflects both a reduction in lots, and the impact of a mix change, together driving 120 basis points of revenue margin compression in the quarter. While lots were down 40%, quarter on quarter closed loan volumes were down 17%, reflecting a pull through of the second-quarter pipeline. And although you do see that our expenses are down some, around 7%, this reflects primarily the transaction level variable costs. We have taken appropriate actions this quarter to adjust capacity, which will fully hit our run rate and exit Q4. On the positive side, our purchase volumes continue to increase and purchase mix was nearly 50% of loans this quarter, up from 35% last quarter. Moving on to servicing, a loss of $226 million pretax excluding MSR risk management. Lower revenues were down due to a couple of items, including the exit of lender place reinsurance. While on an adjusted basis, the servicing revenue would have been up slightly, reflecting the impact of higher rates. Also, servicing expenses were $858 million for the quarter, including approximately $200 million of foreclosure-related matters. If you adjust for this, our core expenses would have been around $650 million, on track for approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as we guided at Investor Day. Finally, you see the MSR showed a modest loss this quarter of $180 million, which includes a negative $120 million due to further HPI improvement, which is also driving higher reserve releases in the real estate portfolios. So on to the real estate portfolio, pretax income of $1.5 billion includes net charge-offs of a little over $200 million, with charge-offs expected at around that same level next quarter. As expected, a continued reduction in delinquencies, but importantly improvement in HPI drove severity down in both NCI and PCI portfolios, which led us to release a combined $1.25 billion of reserves this quarter. Turning the page to page 8, will be card, merchant services, and auto. Revenue of $4.6 billion was down slightly year on year and quarter on quarter, as a result of spread compression, despite strong sales volumes. With net income of $1.2 billion, up 29% year on year, and an ROE of 26%, excluding reserve releases, which reflects strong and consistent growth in sales and interchange revenue. In card, year over year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes, was consistent and strong, at 11% and 14%, respectively, and we saw a slight increase in average outstandings quarter on quarter. Expenses are flat year over year, and down a little quarter over quarter, but the second quarter included a one-time item. The net charge-off rate has reached historic lows at 2.86%, which is down over 70 basis points year on year, and we released $350 million of loan loss reserves this quarter. We expect an additional $150 million of reserve releases next quarter, consistent with our guidance for the second half of the year. Before we move on, a few things on auto, with originations up 2% year on year, and balances 4% year on year. And despite higher rates leading to increased competitive intensity, we are still expecting growth in the fourth quarter year over year. Moving on to slide 9, the corporate & investment bank. We had very strong performance in CIB, with net income of $2.2 billion and an ROE of 16%, despite being a seasonally weaker third quarter and including a DDA loss of nearly $400 million. As usual, we'll focus on the numbers, excluding DDA. We had net income of $2.5 billion on revenues of $8.6 billion, and an ROE of 17%. In banking, total revenue was $2.9 billion, and we maintained our number-one ranking in global IB fees with $1.5 billion, up 6% year on year. We were up in a market that is down overall in wallet, and captured 130 basis points of wallet share over last year. Our market share gains were significantly larger than any of the other top 10 players, and supported by landmark transactions like Verizon. I'll take a second to just give you some color on the strong competitive performance in ECM this quarter. We're number one year-to-date in terms of wallet, gaining 140 basis points a share, and this quarter, we're number one in volume, number one in wallet, and number one in deals. Moving on to markets, $4.7 billion of revenue, down 2% year on year, versus a strong third quarter last year, in line with our guidance that we provided at Barclays. Fixed income markets revenue of $3.4 billion was down 8% year on year, but remember, the third quarter of 2012 did include modest losses in the synthetic credit portfolio. Equity markets revenues of $1.2 billion were up 20% year on year, with broad based strength across cash and derivatives and across regions. Security service revenue of $1 billion was up 3% year on year, with growth in custody and fund services, partially offset by lower agent lending spreads. And credit adjustments and other have a negative $409 million, with almost entirely DDA. Expenses of $5 billion were down 7% year on year, primarily driven by comp, with a comp to revenue ratio of 27% for the quarter. Loans were down slightly primarily due to trade finance, and finally, average CIB VaR remained relatively flat quarter over quarter, at $45 million. The current quarter continues to reflect historically low levels of volatility, as well as continued risk reduction. I'll skip page 10 and take you to page 11 and the commercial bank. The quarter saw net income of $665 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were flat year on year and quarter on quarter, reflecting pressure on NII, offset by favorable franchise trends. Spreads compressed in the quarter 5 basis points or so, from the relatively stable landscape in the last few quarters across most client segments and geographies, and given the environment, it's likely spreads will continue to be under some pressure. In terms of loan balances of $135 billion, up 9% year on year, and 3% quarter on quarter. This remains a tale of two cities. The commercial real estate business continues to grow strongly, up 4% quarter on quarter with loan growth outpacing the market and growing every month for the last 13 months. Multi-family fundamentals are very strong and traditional commercial real estate is building momentum, with both CRE and multi-family pipelines remaining robust. However in C&I, demand remains soft and competitive pressures high, the combination of which has continued to drive relatively flat C&I loans in the quarter, and we continue to focus on quality over growth. Every day we're adding new quality clients, clients with whom we expect to do lots of business over decades to come, and we've added over 600 of these clients year-to-date. And aside from lending, we continue to cross-sell our existing clients, so evidence that growth IB revenues were a record $448 million for the quarter, up 16%. Before we leave CB, two final points. Expenses were up 10% year over year reflecting higher products and headcount expenses as we invest in front office and controls, and credit reflected a relief this quarter as the risk profile of the portfolio continues to improve. Page 12 and asset management. Another very strong quarter for asset management, with net income of $476 million, up 7% year on year, and an ROE of 21%. Revenue was $2.8 billion, up 12% over last year, and while overall higher market levels did help, very strong fund performance and flows drove the story. 74% of our Mutual Fund AUM is ranked in the first or second quartiles of performance over five years, and we saw $19 billion of long term net inflows. This is the 18th consecutive quarter of long term net inflows. Importantly, we saw this in every single long term asset class from every region, and it's brought our year-to-date long term flows to $74 billion, which compares to just less than $60 billion for the full year of 2012. We ended the quarter with AUM of $1.5 trillion, up 12% year on year, and in banking, we continued to see deposit and loan growth across-the-board. And while we expect loan growth to continue to be relatively strong, it's likely to be somewhat lower in Q4, given the lower mortgage pipeline. Expenses increased 16% year on year as we continue to grow and invest in client advisors, and looking forward, we expect long term flows to remain positive, and the breadth of our platform to enable us to grow our business and continue to sustain strong trends. Moving on to page 13, corporate and private equity. A total net loss of $6.5 billion for the quarter, but breaking it down into its constituent pieces, private equity generated net income of $242 million, reflecting gains on certain investments in our $9 billion portfolio. Treasury and CIO showed a net loss of around $200 million, but you'll see that the $261 million of negative NII this quarter is lower than the run rate seen over the last several quarters, which reflects the impact of higher rates, specifically higher yields quarter over quarter, driven by mortgages and reinvestment in munis. In the quarter we deployed $32 billion gross in new investments, primarily agency mortgages and munis, including $5 billion of agency mortgages, which we've classified as held to maturity. As we continue to reinvest, if you follow the forward curve, you should expect NII to continue to improve the CIO Treasury over the next several quarters. And finally, although AOCI ended up relatively flat quarter over quarter, or even up slightly, we did obviously see significant volatility during the quarter. The other corporate net loss of $6.5 billion is driven by the $9.2 billion pretax or $7.2 billion aftertax for litigation expense in the quarter. If you exclude litigation, results for the quarter did include a few positive tax adjustments totaling around $500 million, relating to prior period adjustments, settlements, resolutions and reserve changes, mostly BAU items. So finally, page 14 and our outlook. We've covered most of the outlook going through the presentation, but just a couple of things I would highlight. As expected, our firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were relatively flat this quarter, and given market rates, we expect relatively flat NIM and NII in the near term. The Firm is positioned to benefit from a higher rate environment, and we are starting to see that in our results. Turning to expenses, we expect adjusted expenses in the full year to be between $59.5 billion and $60 billion, as we continue to invest in controls and compliance. Overall our businesses are delivering in terms of leadership growth and financial performance, with double digit growth in key business drivers, as well as market share gains. And as I said, excluding corporate litigation and releases, we returned a 15% return on tangible common equity. I'll hand it over to Jamie who will go through the final slide.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Great, Marianne. Thank you very much and hello everybody. So I'm going to just talk a little bit about things on page 15, because a lot of questions were getting asked about it. It's the three columns, I'll do each one shortly. First, simplifying our business. If you look at what we're doing, we're spinning off one equity partner, selling physical commodities and we closed down a bunch of business lines. I think it's a core business principle to always simplify your business, and to focus on where you can really win. It's a little more amplified this time, because obviously there's a new regulatory environment, capital, and we need to focus a lot of our management mindset on controls. You also, on that first column, you see we're derisking. We're trying to meet new standards we set for ourselves and the regulators wanted to set, to reduce risk to our Company, particularly on anti-money laundering. It will have a revenue effect, so my guess is if you ask, probably a couple hundred million dollars across all of our businesses. The middle column shows you the investments we're making in control. We want to be best-in-class. We want to get to Six Sigma. Its become the number one priority. Just give you an idea, we're going to spend about $1 billion more, and but that's not the effort. The real effort to think about is how much resource we directed to get this right, and there are unprecedented work streams, like 500 people working on CCAR, 500 people working on resolution recovery, we just turned in, a believe it or not 100,000 page plan. We've added 5,000 people, and so this is a permanent investment, these costs aren't going to go away, and it's important we get this exactly right. If you look at the right-hand column, I want to go down that one by one. So I just mentioned it is permanent cost structure will stay in place, but our overhead is very competitive, we're very rigorous in expenses, and we intend to stay that way. So you shouldn't expect to see tremendous increase in our expense base. While we simplified our business, it does not really affect our core businesses, our core products, so Marianne went through the four business lines, it's not going to affect our ability to be extremely competitive. Our fortress balance sheet is intact, and as you know, critically important to us. The high levels of capital liquidity will ultimately affect pricing to clients, but we'll also be able to push down and optimize across the globe effectively, as we adjust to the new global financial architecture. I think it's important to point out that we do have to adjust to a new global financial architecture. It's not just the consentor, there's really rules around the world. We're working hard to do that. We think we will be able to do that, but we go into that with excellent franchises, good underlying growth, and a pretty good long term outlook, because while we operate in violent and volatile businesses around the world, markets go up and down, the underlying growth of asset management, equity, debt, capital markets, global multi-nationals, US consumer needs, middle market needs in the US, will be growing over time. So we think we're in a very good place to serve them. Our people really have done an outstanding job persevering and performing through these difficult times, and you can go back and say its been over five or six years. If you came to the building, I know a lot of you have, you see the employee morale is very high, and hopefully will stay there. And then the last thing, at Investor Day, since a lot of new rules, they won't be completely finalized but we'll know most of them, we'll be able to give you a lot more of an update on how we think this affects our businesses going forward. We're pretty optimistic we'll be able to continue to build a great Company. So we'll stop there, and open the floor to questions. Questions and Answers
JAMIE DIMON: I think it may be a little bit the DC shutdown, but in reality, it's a complex thing. It's a Board level issue and we want a fair and reasonable settlement, if we can. And that's all we can really say about it.
JAMIE DIMON: It involves multiple agencies, so you can imagine the complexity.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, John. Unfortunately, we did as much as we can, give you as much clarity as we can, but we aren't going to be able to break that down for you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so John, the way to think about it, very candidly, is that we didn't expect when we estimated that -- remember it's a very difficult thing to estimate, there's significant uncertainty in terms of the estimate, significant judgment. And when we made those judgments in the second quarter, we didn't anticipate the environment being as volatile and escalating to the point that it has now. So as we have taken our reserves, and the reserves reflect today, so it reflects the current environment and the situation in fact that we're in, and we've now taken that into consideration as we look forward with our reasonably possible range. That's why it hasn't gone down anywhere near dollar to dollar, obviously.
MARIANNE LAKE: All we can say, John, is that we reserve for what's equitable, based on the facts and circumstances specific to each individual exposure, and the overall environment.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a tough environment, John. We're just trying to reflect that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just two things, John, and I think in the Barclays presentation there was a slide that showed that of the increase in our outlook, there was a chunk of it that related to non-core prep litigation, so it certainly isn't entirely to do with our investment in cost and control, much of which we are funding through efficiencies. Having said that, there is an incremental cost. It is in part permanent, and it's going to be reflected in our run rate, but there was a good, I think $500 million is my recollection of other expenses including non-corporate litigation, which as you know, we don't adjust out.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so the longer term target was a $325 million quarterly run rate, but that's over the longer term. What we said about 2013 and are on track to deliver is that we would exit the year with about $600 million of expenses in the fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Which we still expect.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Which is expected. So if you look at the third quarter run rate adjusted, it's about $650 million, down from just over $700 million in the second quarter, so that trend is moving in the right direction.
JAMIE DIMON: So first of all, we're going to get there when we get there, but obviously, this Company is very sound, plenty of capital. We want to pass CCAR, but when you talk about capital plans, it's going to be subject to several things. One is the stock price, subject to passing CCAR with flying colors, which is really the stress test of CCAR, and also subject to wanting to meet our own targets for capital. So we've already said we want to get probably something North of 10% Basel III Tier 1 capital, et cetera and when we know all those numbers, do our budgets, we'll put the proper CCAR plan in place.
MARIANNE LAKE: I was pointing out mainly, Glenn, because I think if you go back several quarters over a year ago, standardized for us was lower than advanced by a reasonable spread, and clearly, when the common [store] amendment is applicable, which is not for a period of time, we would be looking at the lower of those two ratios. Right now, it's higher than the advanced approach, by a little more than 10 basis points.
JAMIE DIMON: We should put out when we do CCAR next year, effectively, it's not the same for every quarter, but effectively, it will be based on Basel III, which is a former volatile number because RWA moves around under stress under Basel III, as opposed under Basel I.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so SLR, which I think you're referring to is 4.7%, remember that would go up by 50 basis points if you just subtracted the cash we hold at central banks. So until final rules come out I wouldn't overreact to it. Obviously SLR, it causes you to optimize differently, and a lot of products which are very high user capital under SLR, think of those as deposits, repo, and any of the short-term and low margin, revolvers et cetera. So it will make you optimize differently, but I think in reality the way we look at it is, we'll be able to adjust to it, we'll probably be able to do it by client. We're going to get to the ratio we need to get to, and we want to do it without disrupting all of our clients. So we will be able to give you more detail when we know the final roles.
MARIANNE LAKE: And remember, Glenn, there is still the possibility there will be changes made to reflect I think the FIN41, which you're talking about, which I think would be positive for the repo market.
MARIANNE LAKE: So on NII, Glenn?
MARIANNE LAKE: So yes, I mean, growth has flattened out in terms of interest earning assets, you seen that obviously take place over the last couple of quarters, and so our guidance is reflecting the fact that we have seen things stabilize, both NIM and NII, and that further near term that's what we're expecting.
JAMIE DIMON: Listen, it's your job to forecast the future. We do think that it's very good businesses, and like I said, it's underlying growth, but obviously it could be swamped in the short run by markets and events, et cetera. We'll provide a lot more in Investor Day, and give you much more insight.
JAMIE DIMON: So, I think there's two major things. First of all, the pre trade and post trade rules are in place, and basically they didn't have that much of effect on the business. And now you have the steps in place, and from talking to folks on the trading floor, volumes seem to be down a little bit, but not because of the steps. The steps are basically accepting data at this point. They are not effectively making mortgage yet, so you haven't seen a huge effect of it. And I think over time, it still remains to be seen.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, because we'll meet the new targets and retain the capital, and eventually, we are actually already pushing down to the business. We're sorting to push down to the business units SLR, all the capital, all the stuff. Eventually, I mean LCR, eventually we'll put down SLR, and that will affect pricing and stuff. What we don't want to do is do a lot of anticipation, but if revolvers stay at SLR at 100% drawn, the cost will go up. I'm not sure they will go up immediately but they will go up over time so we'll be able to get there. We just don't want to do stupid things in anticipation of rules, which we don't know what they are yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Betsy, our businesses are thinking through all of the implications. When the rules come out, we'll be able to act, but think about it as a measured approach. We don't want to overreact. We want to see how things play out, and at the margin, there will be changes to products and pricing but we'll be very measured.
JAMIE DIMON: So cash at central banks doesn't have to hold capital against, that's 50 basis points. If you took revolvers down to what we say is a normal draw, like even a stress draw of 20% which is what we saw in the crisis, there will be another 50 basis points, so we just want to be a little measured in how we deal with this.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, Betsy, this is really just the basic underlying run rate, which is about $650 million. Which does include some severance obviously, given actions taken to adjust capacity in the business, together with the $200 million item, which relates to foreclosure, it's nothing else.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, not anything of any significance. We have done some, but nothing major.
JAMIE DIMON: We would love to reduce the uncertainty around this for ourselves and for you, but it's very hard to do. So the way I'd look at it is it will probably be elevated for the next year or two, not like we just went through, but it will necessarily be lumpy. So it might be as we settle, as we negotiate, as we figure out -- remember there are multiple agencies involved in every case now, so you saw in the CIO that we paid four, maybe eventually five penalties, which we really did not expect. So we just have to deal with it and deal with the reality that it is. It will
JAMIE DIMON: I wish I could give you a better answer, but one day, it won't be a big number.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I think you have to look at first of all, the big ones are really Board-level type of discussions and we -- our preference is always to resolve it. It is very hard to fight with your regulators or the Federal Government, but we want them to be fair and reasonable. We have shareholders, and those shareholders, by the way, I remind people, it's not me. It's veterans or retirees and mothers and we're trying to do the right thing. It's very hard. We've got the top people involved inside and outside the Company, and hopefully over time, we will make this a much smaller issue.
JAMIE DIMON: Well it does, but again, we think we've maintained pretty good margins and pretty good capital, and we have different ways to optimize. And not all of the things we're simplifying were very profitable, and so remember, let's just focus on other things and the other things we're doing pretty well. Like almost every single business, we're up in share. And remember, the reason you go up in share is because you're doing a good job for clients. They vote with their feet, which means you're satisfying them. So we're comfortable we'll be able to adjust to the new world and still have great businesses, and again, you haven't seen all of the repricing that might take place, you haven't seen the reactions and change in business strategies, and some things may move to the shadow banking world, which is fine. We'll figure it out. Like I mentioned, the needs of our clients, consumer, small business, middle market, large corporate, are not going away. They have to be served and satisfied somewhere.
JAMIE DIMON: We've said 30% to 35%, and remember we do it pretty consistently after capital, and looking at value created, stuff like that so that hasn't changed, just came down a little this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: We said there were modest loss last year (multiple speakers) and they were about breakeven this quarter, and it's getting very small.
MARIANNE LAKE: Erica, two things. One is, if you just look at the firm wide leverage ratio for a second that 4.7%, obviously that maybe changes when the final rules are issued, but just take that as a base. We're only 30 basis points from the minimum and while we're targeting to go higher than that, clearly 30 basis points is not a great distance for us to cover. And then I'd just reiterate what Jamie said, which is when we look at our 2014 CCAR, it will take into account a balanced set of facts and circumstances, so obviously both the quantitative and qualitative nature of the results of the stress test, but also our desire to want to get to capital levels that we've expressed, together with maintaining flexibility to do appropriate dividends and repurchases. So all those things together will be considered in the capital plan.
MARIANNE LAKE: So three things, just to clarify. Currently our standardized ratio is higher than advanced, albeit not by very wide margin, so just to clarify that point. Just generically, the advanced approach RWA sensitivity to a stress environment would be more impacted than a standardized approach, but remember, that's a 2014, that's a future issue for us. The 2014 CCAR, as we understand the instructions, we will be looking at an additional test on top of the 5% Basel I, that will have a Basel I risk weighted assets for the denominator for the first four quarters, and Basel III standardized for the second four quarters. So it's a 2014 CCAR, the advanced approach isn't one of the critical tests, although it will likely be in the future. But in theory and in reality, that will reduce more dramatically on the stress than the other measure.
MARIANNE LAKE: It was relatively flat, Mike, in the low 30s, between 30% and 31%.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's consistent with what we said at Investor Day, in terms of the remaining jobs turning out of the branch networking consumer, as we implement new technology and new operating models, and new branch formats.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I guess we're making huge progress on it, but it's not going to stop for years. It's permanent.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Mike, just what it's worth on page 2, very small in the footnote, we talk about that estimate of about 80% of MBS deal losses related to heritage investments.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: When you saw mortgage putback, are you talking about the GSE putback?
JAMIE DIMON: I think have you to get that from other analysts who actually have published numbers like that.
JAMIE DIMON: I think -- obviously, that's true, Mike, so because this is very painful for the Company, and so Bear Sterns we did do quickly. We didn't anticipate that we would be paying anything for prior losses for Bear Sterns. I tell people, even the Bear Sterns number, I think it was $80 billion of bonds were made good which would have failed that day, had they gone bankrupt. And we did ask, we weren't completely stupid. We did ask the SEC for and only the SEC for would they please agree not to take enforcement actions against JPMorgan against things that happened at Bear, which of course they couldn't do outright, but they did say they would take into consideration the circumstances in which the transaction took place. And in WaMu, we don't believe we're responsible by contract. But that does not mean that people can't come after you. So that was a little bit of a lesson learned too.
JAMIE DIMON: We're going to do what's in the best interest of our shareholders, all things considered, it's a Board level decision. And it needs to be fair, reasonable, taking consideration all of the facts and have some possible -- we would like to get it done, and if we can't, that's the Board will make that decision. It's not a good choice either way.
MARIANNE LAKE: Mike, the factor there was candidly that you were all trying to do this, you had most, or at least a large number of analysts that published research papers trying to recreate settlements and reserves three times, and for this one time only, we felt like it was helpful and transparent and constructive to show you the magnitude of reserves after these actions. So that you can have that context when you think about the future.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so first of all just to give context to that 6% to 7% down quarter over quarter, there is a portion of our expense base related to mortgage that's truly variable, so as production levels go down, we pay less compensation on the loans, and as a result, that's what you're seeing in this quarter. With respect to then rightsizing the expense base for the opportunity in the market, we have taken actions, as you have are aware in the third quarter, to start to do that; however, once you go beyond the truly variable costs, those actions take some four, or cases six months to truly get to the run rate. So while we would expect to see that start to come to fruition in the fourth quarter, not completely in the quarter, more as a run rate matter. And then there is a portion of costs that are more fixed, in terms of our ability to be able to participate, whether it's real estate technology and a core infrastructure. We are obviously also taking a look at that, but we are in this business, and so there will be an element of fixed costs into obviously next year. But you should expect that we're still seeing, absent lots go down slightly into the fourth quarter, so you should expect revenues will maybe be down, but expenses will also be down, for that net slight negative pretax margin that we've guided you to. That's still what we expect.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me brag on our commercial bank and investment bank bankers And they've opened up branches I want to say Jacksonville, Sacramento, Nashville, so we're actually in more places in the commercial bank. Obviously, we've been building in the WaMu footprint in Florida and California, they've been doing an exceptional job. And more importantly a high quality job, like we're really happy with the quality of the business we're booking. And our Investment Bankers you see the numbers in equity and debt and we didn't mention all of the deals that we are involved in but Verizon, and Sprint, and Nokia, there's good pipelines and good traffic. You know that can change tomorrow, but the fact is, we are satisfying our clients and we're thrilled with the business we're generating.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we don't expect or believe there should be any repercussions, but ultimately that's the regulators' decision so we resubmitted CCAR in September. We're still waiting for feedback. We get feedback in early December. We will do a good, thoughtful and appropriate job of thinking through our capital asks as we do the 2014 CCAR, so those will be the things that we do.
JAMIE DIMON: And we're doing very little stock buyback right now.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, Volker, more detail on SLR, more detail on how much long term debt, I think we have almost 20% of available resources today. And then you could look at things very basic and simple and say okay, well if the cost is a little bit higher and pricing stays the same and capital is higher, returns a little bit lower, that's true. But that doesn't take into consideration things we don't know which is repricing, competitor strategies, and our ability to optimize by client, by state, by region, by product So all those things, we just give you a better idea. We're very comfortable we've got a very good business, but we'll give you a better idea of what we think it means by business. For example, we're going to allocate more capital and operating capital to the businesses, we'll ask them to optimize on SLR, and without damaging the client franchise, but we just will give you more detail. That's all.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think that a lot of people mentioned that they think it was inappropriate to apply capital to that, but the regulators will decide, whatever it is, we will be able to adjust to and conform to the rules. I would just point out that some of these things can move that number quite a bit and there's a reason why you shouldn't overreact to it and just take the time and do it right. We know the final rules, we will conform.
JAMIE DIMON: We conform very quickly, so it's just why would you conform very quickly and disrupt clients? So just think of it that way. We're trying to do the right thing to the client base and the Company.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't want to restrict, we could go out tomorrow and say we aren't going to make anymore revolvers, and we will be there very quickly. We just don't want to do that. It's not a rational way to run a business.
JAMIE DIMON: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: We are going to meet our targets through the run-off portfolio, which will cause a couple of things. Part of the CRM was a synthetic credit portfolio, which is, I'll say, 1/10 of the size it was a year ago and I don't remember the exact numbers, and we're still going to be optimizing across other products. There's certain things in mortgages that use up a lot of capital, et cetera. So we have more to go in optimizing RWA.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no, that one, but they had a small correlation book in the IB, this was a synthetic credit portfolio moved over to the IB, and eventually it will probably be put together.
JAMIE DIMON: And much smaller.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we've received instructions and that does feature.
MARIANNE LAKE: And it wouldn't be the first time we modeled such an event as part of our stress testing.
JAMIE DIMON: No. I think you should take that, I mean obviously it's very painful for me personally, because I agree with you, I don't like losing money obviously for my shareholders, and we put up, and Marianne has been very clear. These are very tough numbers to estimate, it's a heightened environment, multiple agencies are involved in often the same thing. We're just trying to improve and get better and move on. Remember, these reserves relate to things that took place over multiple years, so it isn't a one year event, and we still didn't lose money during the crisis.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I'm not expecting that the details and results will necessarily become public. Remember, it wasn't a quantitative issue per se. It was a qualitative issue, so what the regulators are looking for is our response to their recommendations and substantial progress in that. I do think that it obviously would be public what their response has been to that, some time in December, and we'll work out exactly when that would be. So I would expect you to understand whether our plan has been accepted or otherwise at some point in December. And we're already working on the 2014 CCAR submission. Obviously that submission in early January, which means it's will be Board approval in December and that is starting. All of the work, and Jamie talked about it, he talked about 500 people, thousands of people involved, models, documentation, covenants, controls, all of that work that we did for the resubmission is fully being leveraged for our ongoing CCAR processes, and we're building on it. So this for us will continue to become better over time, and 2014 will be another step in that process.
MARIANNE LAKE: Really most significantly, the other thing that we just talked about, which is in addition to all of the other minimum levels that we've been testing against, we have new tests under Basel III, albeit a test that recognizes savings in the capital numerator, and also a slightly different denominator through time, with different minimum levels of 4% in 2014, and 4.5% in 2015. So that's the other real big framework change.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we obviously can't comment on any sort of discussions or status of any specifics on litigation. Yes, you're right, the framework is probably an estimate. Also you should obviously assume that we didn't or couldn't estimate, all of these events were not probable at the time. But today, our reserves are appropriate for the current environment, and the information that we're allowed.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're estimating some penalties, given the environment we would expect that some of the expenses would come with penalty nature, and you can obviously do the math from the front page.
MARIANNE LAKE: But they are estimates and they include a range of matters not limited to mortgage.
MARIANNE LAKE: Actually, it's a great question. There is a fronting in that number of just shy of $2 billion, $1.7 billion that will ultimately be syndicated in the short-term, so I would adjust that out when you're looking at the quarter over quarter numbers. Other than that, it's relatively flat and steady performance in core middle market and strength in real estate.
MARIANNE LAKE: We can't comment.
JAMIE DIMON: We've already said all we can say about that.
JAMIE DIMON: It's going well but we're still, I think they are still building the systems to actually do it, and come with the products and services that we think can do a better job both for the merchants and for customers.
MARIANNE LAKE: But we're in active-JAMIE DIMON: We're still working on that. That's not going to happen overnight. We just think it could be a very good thing over time.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, we will try to.
MARIANNE LAKE: We will.
JAMIE DIMON: Essentially has flattened out at this point, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: And we've begun to reinvest, we're looking at the overall portfolio, we're doing some rotation, and that process has started.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, rates did go up almost 100 basis points.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just at a macro level, talking at the firm-wide level for a second, we've said that we're looking at running the firm at a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio between 10% to 10.5%, which would imply, in any case Tier 1 capital minimums will be 11% ultimately, so we'll be at 11%-plus from Tier 1 capital and we talked about leverage running at 5.5% over time as well. And if you think about 11%-plus Tier 1 capital, 10% to 10.5% Basel III common and a 5.5% supplementary leverage ratio given the ratio of our risk weighted assets to our balance sheet, they actually co-exist quite happily. So it is going to be a multi-variance of finding constraints, but at those levels, they exist quite nicely. Obviously the devil is in the detail when you push down into the businesses, client by client, product by product, and that work will go on, and as we do that work, as Jamie's talked about, we expect to be able to optimize, which will include some repricing and some restructuring of products. But at a macro level, they will co-exist relatively well.
JAMIE DIMON: I always add to that CCAR will be in our opinion another binding constraint over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Very good point.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't know those rules yet, but presumably it's going to be equity plus preferred plus unsecured senior debt, and subordinated debt. And I think our number is at 20% of risk weighted assets there, so we're in a pretty good place but we'll see what the final rules are.
MARIANNE LAKE: So with PCI-JAMIE DIMON: I have to go because I have a meeting I have to go to, but appreciate the time with us, and Marianne can answer the remaining questions.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the way to think about the PCI reserve release its the first one we've taken, and it reflects obviously improved home prices and lower severities, but it's divided by model, so if all other things from here are equal, then we are what we are. Obviously, if there are significant changes, probably primarily in home prices, but also in delinquencies, and you might see some more reserve releases. These are likely to be more periodic and lumpy, because obviously, we will be refreshing our loan loss reserves, or our life of loan forecasts over time. It's possible that you may see them in multiple quarters but that's not what we're expecting.
MARIANNE LAKE: No there's no cause and effect there, obviously.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well there's no cause and effect there. Full stop.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well I can certainly talk for JPMorgan, where as soon as we understand rules, we start to push them down into the organization, so that the people who are transacting at the products and the client level can make the best and most appropriate decisions to maximize returns and meet hurdles, and all of those sorts of good things. And you're right. Over the last several years, we have seen capital and liquidity increase dramatically. Meanwhile we are still delivering a core underlying performance in that mid-teens return on tangible common equity. So we're still competing effectively, which leads me to believe that others are doing the same thing, and that's being reflected in the competitive nature of the environment. I think it's obviously going to continue some, as we and others have set ourselves even higher targets for capital, and then obviously new rules including the SLR, but I also do think these things work through the system through time pretty quickly, given the nature of the business.
MARIANNE LAKE: So our LCR ratio last quarter was 118%. This quarter, we haven't disclosed it, but it's not far off that same level. and the increase in cash is not necessarily because we're trying to do anything from a liquidity perspective, but it also reflects inflows from clients, both operating bills, and importantly non-core non-operating deposits that we then place with the central banks.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.",0.1499999999999999,0.6070000000000001,1,0.09151471893492402,0.10109216821474111
18,Q3_2010,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: That decision is made all the time, it changes all the time. Interest rate exposures, and what securities you like, and timing of sales and stuff like that. Some of that will bounce around, not a deliberate growth strategy in securities.
JAMIE DIMON: So a long question there. I think on the risk weighted asset side, we talk about natural mitigants, things that are going to run off over time, not really actions we're taking, just securitizations or retail loans, some of those things run off over time, there will be -- remember, we're economic animals. We're not going to sell something that we think is a good asset or good return because the RWA is too high relative to capital. So no one should look at us, say we're going to have to sell something cheap. We have plenty of capital. We can hold whatever we want. We're going to make economic decisions, not Basel-III related decisions. I do think that you're going to find people, some other natural owners of certain assets that don't have the same kind of regulatory or capital stuff. I don't think that's going to be an unbelievable material thing for us. In a different kind of business it might be more material. When people really go through this they're going to be able to manage contract, clearing houses, CVA/DVA, which will diminish the RWA effect pretty dramatically over time. People will really learn how to manage it better. We haven't tried to do all that. We're not worried about it because we don't really need the capital.
JAMIE DIMON: We're pretty confident in the new world we'll earn good returns for shareholders. When you talk about reprice, if you're referring to Retail, it's going to take a while to design the exact product, the exact fees, exactly when to do it. There may be a little timing difference when it's costing us more money as we design those products and roll them out but eventually we'll have to reprice it, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Not specifically. They're waiting for this thing in Korea November 20th. At one point, we hope to get some guidance. In any event, we think that we're in very good shape.
JAMIE DIMON: I think everybody's waiting for final Basel-III guidance. The regulators are putting us through additional stress tests and I think everyone's waiting to get that done. I'll make the same statement I made before. I think it's reasonably hopeful that sometime in the first quarter we can reinstall a dividend or something like that. I think it makes sense to do. I think some banks will start retaining far too much excess capital at one point next year.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, they are. But they're going through their own calculations and they obviously want to look at the global issues before they make any final determinations.
JAMIE DIMON: It would down a little bit next quarter. Most of it's in Corporate. If you look at absolute dollars, we have it in our portfolios.
JAMIE DIMON: Can you get closer to your phone, Guy?
JAMIE DIMON: Not quite as well, but keep going.
JAMIE DIMON: I would assume mostly very liquid. I wouldn't assume it's all very low margin.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say fairly short. But that moves around a lot. It may not be the same thing the next time we talk to you.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say the same thing. We're already very close to the 7% Basel-III requirement, which includes that buffer. I know the Swiss came in at 10 which I think is too high. Remember, this should be consistent with stress tests. When the American government did the stress test at 4% Basel-I, we made the adjustments to capital RWA. 7% is close to 12% Basel-I. Almost a triple of what the banks were able to survive under the worst recession of all time under the stress test. So we think the 7% is a very strong number. And we don't -- I personally don't think there's going to be a market for -- the Swiss has another 9% for CoCos. I think that's extremely optimistic and almost impossible to occur. So I think we have different issues. The size of the bank versus the size of their country, so they've got to do what they think is right for them. I would put those numbers in the extreme category.
JAMIE DIMON: It's going to take several weeks to go through the files and make sure and correct any errors that are in there. We believe the underlying stuff is all accurate. Okay? So that's the key substance. Obviously we know there's a lot of state AGs. We have conversations with them. We're hoping the normal process -- for us, the sooner the better for everybody involved. We don't think there are cases with people have been evicted out of homes where they shouldn't have been. These foreclosures go through multiple processes, so we're hoping it will be sooner rather than later and those conversations are starting to take place.
JAMIE DIMON: No, nothing in it for this topic. I think the way you should look at this topic is that we're burying today $7 billion of charge-offs, foreclosure, repurchase costs, this is ex-reserves. That $7 billion will go up or down based upon the economy and stuff like this. I'm not sure stuff like this is going to dramatically change that number. It may extend it a little bit longer and stuff like that but -- and remember, we have in total, between the purchased reserves and $11 billion, we have $14 billion of reserves for repurchases or loan losses. Look, the mortgage thing is -- we're halfway through all this. We think we should continue and get done and make sure we do the right thing for the consumers, the investors and the country. Obviously it will increase our costs a little bit, and maybe we'll have to pay penalties eventually to some of the AGs. We really think it's just continuing.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: You know our society, right? You know how many lawsuits go on and class action suits and stock drop suits and Bear Stearns suits and WaMu suits. It ain't going away. Yes, we always try to get ahead of t it. We're not going to give you specific detail. When we're wrong, we're going to settle. When we're right we're going to fight. Not all of those reserves were mortgage-related. They were related to other items we have to deal with as a Company and we do try to be ahead of it. We try to be very ahead of it, because we think it's the right thing to do.
JAMIE DIMON: It's one of the reasons we tell you it's going to come down next quarter. We don't necessarily expect all those favorable roles to continue the way they continued. Remember, we're pretty creative in finding way to do NII. There are other things to buy and other things to do. But we positioned the Company more and more for raising rates, less rates, portfolios may come down, the benefits of roles may go away. We don't have to buy low duration mortgage assets. We can buy other things too.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the likely outcome is for continued trend down and remember, in the Credit Card business, those losses tend to relate more to new unemployment claims and new unemployment, not just absolute level. If you look through history. And also, after two and-a-half years you charge off 20% so you really have worked through a lot of the bad accounts.
JAMIE DIMON: So the $35 billion of reserves, you go through your own numbers, that's going to normalize a lot lower than $35.
JAMIE DIMON: And the trading desk, you all look at one month that got slow, one month it's fast, but pretty good client activity. I don't see any reason why there wouldn't be pretty good client activity.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know if we disclosed the numbers. More than 50% opted in. We're not going to be disclosing those numbers all the time. It's going to change as people change their mind. Remember they can at any point in time opt in or opt out.
JAMIE DIMON: The number we gave you is right for the wrong reasons.
JAMIE DIMON: Again, I hope -- this is a hope. This is not a knowledge. Is that when people take a deep, sigh breath, go back to the right, look to the substance underlying the files and go back to modifying, foreclosing and doing the right thing, all told, it could be a blip. Talking about three or four weeks it will be a blip in the housing market. If it went on for a long period of time, it will have a lot of consequences, most of which would be adverse on everybody.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: It rolls in over five years or something like that. So we have lots of capital and so we're really not managing capital or RWA as much as we're trying to build the business, clients, brokers, traders, salesmen, we have plenty of capital to grow the business in an intelligent way. A lot of those numbers we showed at the Barclays presentation, they were not heroic. They were just kind of runoff with basic stuff we know about. I do think people do a much tighter job of managing those things if and when it becomes important.
JAMIE DIMON: That's correct.
JAMIE DIMON: My guess is we're going to start reporting it to you all at one point just so you see what the number would be when we know what the final rules out. My guess is we'll be compliant with whatever the number is sometime next year.
JAMIE DIMON: A teeny bit, but nothing heroic, but it was basic stuff.
JAMIE DIMON: If it had to be done next year we can get it done next year. We could do 10% next year if we wanted to.
JAMIE DIMON: We could get to 10% BASEL-III next year if we desired. We'd have to make some tougher decisions and sell things and stop doing a bunch of stuff, but if that's what we wanted to do, we could do it.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, we could do a lot of different stuff. People are going to make decisions to get compliant quicker than people think. That's what's going to happen in the marketplace.
JAMIE DIMON: I always feel good that we don't have to do M&A. We can just grow our business and do a good job for our shareholders. We're going to generate a lot of excess capital. Of course we can own the businesses or buy back stock or do M&A. We're open minded to M&A if there's something that made sense. We're always looking for bolt-ons and adds in all of the businesses so we would be open.
JAMIE DIMON: I can't tell you that. Think about Morgan, the other Morgan.
JAMIE DIMON: We look all the time.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not going to give you an answer about next quarter but I think at one point going forward when everything clarifies around BASEL, we could be an aggressive buyer of our own stock if we think the price is cheap. We're not going to do it at any price. We're not like everybody else. Low price we do it, high price we don't. We have plenty of capital generation. If that's the thing that makes the most sense for shareholders, you can assume that's what we're going to do. Doesn't mean every week we buy back what we issued that week, that means generally during the course of the year, but I do that at a minimum.
JAMIE DIMON: We're just not going to tell you what we're going to do with our stock. We're just not -- we look out, looking a couple years, how much capital, what the options are, what makes the most sense for shareholders.
JAMIE DIMON: I think that's all over the place. Commercial Bank we're starting to see signs of life and maybe we'll start to see growth in the next three to six months. Credit Card, it will bottom out we think in the third quarter of next year. That includes a runoff and all the other stuff. Treasury, Asset Management, we actually had loan growth, Treasury trade finance, we expect maybe to see both. And then consumer, auto generally would expect to see growth and the big one, is the $200 billion runoff of stuff a lot of which was acquired from WaMu, that will be running off for years.
JAMIE DIMON: We've got to remember, this is an important thing, when it runs off, first of all, somebody's losing money, but when it runs off, it frees up capital. So we're not losing potential earnings, because we can go do something else with it. It's not like on all these other -- some other types of businesses. You're right, leads to negative revenues, but it does not necessarily lead to negative profits.
JAMIE DIMON: That went to -- most of that goes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We could change that too and retain more if we thought that made more sense for our shareholders.
JAMIE DIMON: Volumes are high. Spreads are high. Unfortunately, it's offset by that repurchase cost because that's a contra revenue item in that and I think so far volumes are still good and spreads are still fairly high.
JAMIE DIMON: Markets set rates. There are a lot of people price mortgages around the world. That's usually what determines rates. Sometimes it's how much the system can handle. Sometimes it's people's use of credit spreads. It's a whole bunch of different stuff. No bank sets the rate.
JAMIE DIMON: I confessed multiple times that one of the biggest professional mistakes I ever made was not to get rid of that channel sooner. We did it a while back. I guess you just weren't paying attention.
JAMIE DIMON: The spreads will go up and down. It's still such a critical product for the American consumer. We don't know how the GSE is going to be redone or the mortgage markets, and we do think a lot of work needs to be done on both. End of the day, servicing mortgages and originating mortgages for clients will still be a good business with we think a good return. MSR, I think the only material change in the MSR when we all decide that rates are low and low forever, MSR is one big item, to how we handle the MSR might be a little different.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, every portfolio decision is a kind of almost a discrete decision so whether we retain a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac whole loan which is conforming, or buy an adjustable rate security in the security portfolio, those are almost the same kind of decisions so you have seen some of that taking place but it's in the securities portfolio, not in the balance sheet of Retail.
JAMIE DIMON: On the balance sheet, correct.
JAMIE DIMON: When you look at the jumbo markets, by the way, because the agencies increased their loan limits a lot more of the jumbo stuff is going to them. Eventually that jumbo stuff may be done and sent to balance sheets of banks.
JAMIE DIMON: We just told you all our BASEL numbers. I think we'll probably be updating you all. BASEL-II was 10 years in the making and it was never done. When we get the final -- what we think might be close to the final rules by the end of November, we'll probably start telling you roughly, not specifically, what the BASEL-III numbers will be and when we'll be there and stuff like that, just so you're aware.
JAMIE DIMON: Hey, Mike.
JAMIE DIMON: How are our DTAs, Mike?
JAMIE DIMON: No. Actually, I think the way to look at it is the utilization, these are middle markets, I think it's more representative than Corporate, they can go to the marketplace too. The middle market use their revolvers to grow and expand. That utilization is about the same but actual loan demand, including unused is actually up a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: And actual balances are up a little bit versus the last quarter. So that's the first time in I'm going to say two years.
JAMIE DIMON: I hear generally some of the same stuff anecdotally from other banks too.
JAMIE DIMON: I'd say instead of it going down it may actually be going up a little bit but I wouldn't call it accelerating yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. I think the investment banking business is doing really well in Asia. Remember, Asia is doing well so we grow with the market and the economy and we've added bankers and clients and so we're obviously building up there. And I think on the consumer side, there will be no build. Okay, there will be no build in the consumer side in Asia. It's too hard to do. We're not going to try. Sometime in the future, and that could be two years, one year or 20, a buy is -- I'd put it at a pretty high likelihood.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but that's what I'm saying, I wouldn't pick the timetable here. If it doesn't make sense we're not going to do it. I think we create the most opportunity for JPMorgan, really buying -- you don't buy consumer. You basically buy a bank and it comes with all the attendant businesses with it. I think the time will be when JPMorgan is doing well, the dollar is doing well, financing costs are low and maybe Asia is not doing quite as well. I would say now is not the time.
JAMIE DIMON: We may do something now but I don't think it will be kind of the nature you're talking about.
JAMIE DIMON: I didn't say weeks to clean up the files. We actually have to have little in depth conversations with regulators and AGs and stuff like that. So I don't know exactly when. I'm hopeful that it all starts to move at one point. I don't know if it's going to be three weeks or five. But I think it will be a real shame if we don't get this resolved and moving again.
JAMIE DIMON: I hope so. It's not up to me.
JAMIE DIMON: Expense.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: No. It's a $250 million a quarter of expense. It's not clear we're going to need any additional reserve. If we do, we'll add some. Pretty quickly. At one point the $3 billion will be excess. There's a good chance it will be $1 billion expense for four quarters, six quarters, and then that expense will be going against the reserve which we'll no longer need.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, I hope so. We can't promise that.
JAMIE DIMON: Could be the end of it but there's a chance that things deteriorate in a way we don't understand.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, we also look at a lot of underlying assumptions, request, aging, vintages, loss rates, et cetera. If those change, obviously we'll have to change the reserves a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't know any better than you do, with one comment. Home equity will lag because home equity by its nature, we find lags the underlying prime and the underlying real estate and lags more than most other things. We try to account for that in our reserving. We actually adjust for it in how we reserve.
JAMIE DIMON: We stopped a while back using them for that purpose and so it's not -- I don't think it's relative to us, to other people, we're not going to comment on all the other underlying things. One of the things you've got to remember, there are -- we've known there are issues in the mortgage business. And but for the most part by the time you get to the end of the process, we're not evicting people who deserve to stay in the house.
JAMIE DIMON: It's been this way for a long time and it didn't undercut us.
JAMIE DIMON: Number two, the regulators have said that they're going to try to make sure that they understand that these things may not have been equally applied in jurisdictions around the world, and it is incumbent upon them to make sure there's a level playing field because you've noted the same thing that we've all noted. I'm not going to worry about it particularly much right now.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm only going to say one thing about it, okay?
JAMIE DIMON: In purchased reserves and litigation, unclear exactly how or where it's going to show up but we do think there's going to be some of that when we make the statement that some of these things may go on for a while it relates also to that, that while we're burning through the vintages of the GSE, there are other vintages, more of a time lag than that. And I think it's also important to note that they're fundamentally different. Because a lot of the private label stuff didn't have the same rules, requirements, disclosures, all that, so they're all different.
JAMIE DIMON: And but loan by loan, it's going to have the same -- some of the same characteristics. If people are right, you're going to have to make them whole. If people sue just to win they're making a huge mistake.
JAMIE DIMON: To the extent we can.
JAMIE DIMON: Reserves are -- can't guess and put up numbers but to the extent we can. I think the question is between the reserves we have is how long losses relating to repurchase, whether it's GSE or private label, and whether it shows up on the litigation or repurchase reserve, how long they go on for. We don't expect it to be a blow-up kind of number, we expect it will drag out these losses as these things play themselves out.
JAMIE DIMON: Charge-offs were what in middle market?
JAMIE DIMON: Middle market.
JAMIE DIMON: Middle market charge-offs were very good. Another thing we should point out, that deposits in this Commercial Bank are up dramatically. So we actually think the balance sheet of these companies are in very good shape.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't -- I think you might see that because they might use deposits before they take down loans. I'm just saying we think they're in good -- like Corporate America is in good financial shape. We think middle market commercial banking in America is in good shape too. They're just waiting for more orders.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think it's going to affect our Fixed Income business at all. I think that all this resolution activity is it's important to be done right, and I think we'll see a lot of to and from-ing as people figure out what the right part is. It's going to need some international coordination. It really does need to be done right. The devil's in the detail. As of yet I don't see it changing Fixed Income at all.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: I think, Nancy, I think I already mentioned that the way I look at it, we're burying $5 billion of charge-offs a year, $1 billion of repurchase reserves a year, a lot of REO foreclosure, I forget offhand, but they're big numbers, that those numbers may bounce up and down and probably may go up a little bit because of this but I'm not sure they're going to materially change because of this.
JAMIE DIMON: And there will be litigation, I'd put it to the side. I don't know how it's all going to be sorted out.
JAMIE DIMON: I didn't say confident. I said hopeful. Look, people make a good point. The banks going into this crisis -- not all of them. I don't want to paint them all with the same brush. Some of them kept their dividends really, really high for a real long period of time when they should have been retaining capital and with real low capital ratios. I think some of those complaints are legitimate but they're not legitimate for everyone involved. The new 7% BASEL-III incorporates that as you go below the buffer, the first 2.5% that there will be restrictions on dividend and comp and personally I think that's reasonable. It's where they set the limits and how they set it but to me that's -- if you go to -- the lower your number gets, the less you can raise dividends, you have to cut dividends, you have to cut comp. That's not unreasonable. That's the way a Company should be run. I think that's probably what he's referring to. Built into the regulatory regime as opposed to not.
JAMIE DIMON: And the other thing about dividends, it's really there's so much uncertainty, it's clarifying now around BASEL-III, capital requirements, systemically important firm requirements, resolution. People are being hesitant on capital. They want to have more clarity around it. The reason we have confidence is we have so much capital.
JAMIE DIMON: Hey, Carole.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think we're benefiting from the fact that the industry is under pressure. And look, I would think you're not going to see a big turnaround in sentiment until I think we have a healthy and growing economy. And I also think you're going to see a lot of rules and regulations, going to take a year or more to go through. It's just our lot in life. Just got to deal with it.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you very much. Doug, congratulations on your first time.",0.09999999999999998,-0.6030000000000002,0,0.10666615642168364,0.1497983751408409
19,Q3_2011,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Great, thanks Doug. So hello everybody. Let me just cover a couple quick things, then we will open it up to questions and comments. Page 16 has a page called Comments on 2012. I just want to point out to you as usual we focus on the negatives and the issues, and not the positives. We have great franchises. Doug mentioned some really astounding numbers. Small-business loans up 71%; middle-market loans up 18%; trade finance up 71%; deposits retail up 7%; deposits Commercial Bank up something like 30% or 40%. I won't include TSS because some of that may be a little a flight to quality, but up $100 billion. Unbelievable liquidity. So we feel very good about all the things. But having said that, just a couple quick comments. Investment Bank, we say -- hard not to be cautious. I would say that right now nobody -- nobody knows what is going to happen tomorrow. So I have seen markets like this where things stabilize; Europe does something big and things take off. There are fairly large backlogs and we pointed out to you before backlogs are very deceptive. But you know, you can't look at these things and not expect maybe this will go a little bit longer. We have no major layoff programs. Obviously the Investment Bank will be trimming its sails a little bit, getting tight. And there are some benefits of getting from -- rolling in some new productive systems. So we expect to see their headcount going down, but no major layoff programs. Asset Management obviously dependant on market levels; but we continue to build the business and even this quarter had net inflow. We don't know about other people yet, but I think that is probably pretty good. Consumer & Business Banking, Doug has already mentioned Durbin. This $600 million is the same as the other $1 billion you saw; this is just after-tax. This is the actual revenue in effect minus what we have already done, but not including what we might do. So we are looking at products, services, how we want to do it, how we are going to price it, and try to be a little creative and smart and do something really neat. But -- so we are just saying that that one thing alone is that -there may be other sides to that one. And there is a little bit of spread compression, given the low interest rates that, if all things adjusted for now, if we just kind of reinvested at the same duration, etc., it would impact net income by $400 million. I just want to point out, that is purely up to us. We can do that or not do that. If rates go -- it is really longer-term rates that this is the effect of; and we can wait or not wait. So at this point it would be our decision. Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services. Their margins would be low as long as rates stay low. So they are positioned to benefit from raising rates when and if that happens. Quarterly net income Doug already mentioned. I would just say Private Equity -- if things stay like this you shouldn't expect any profit this quarter. And then just to point out, we haven't really spoken of this before, part of Private Equity is marked to market, part of it is marked to model, which means marked to P/Es and stuff. So that you can think of it -- several billion dollars are in effect marked to market pretty much. And then obviously in Corporate also these are Firm decisions. Depending how long we go in duration, depending how much risk, we take depending what happens to the rest of the balance sheet -- we will decide when and how to use some of our firepower to create more income. We are just talking about the negative part right now. Reserve release. I think it has been pointed out by several people already that we didn't take reserves down. We are fighting not to take them down. We may not be able to not take them down, because obviously we operate under a bunch of accounting rules. But our predilection right now is, with delinquencies kind of flattening out, there are some good signs, there are some bad signs -- it is all over the place. We would rather just leave them up until we have to take them down. So don't read anything into that other than we are just trying to be conservative here. We are going to spend a lot of time literally the next six or nine months particularly to build our budgets, dealing with regulatory issues. So what we want to do is build in at the product level, the legal level, liquidity, capital, G-SIFI, whatever we have to deal with so we can properly price and manage our businesses going forward. I do think it will have effects on a whole bunch of areas. We haven't calculated it yet now; but if I had to guess, it is going to add $0.5 billion to overhead over time as we put all these systems and reporting in. I want to point out that I think some of that is a waste of money. But that is life; we simply have to do it. The last point under Other -- I gave one issue on business issues about branch build. I think we are going to build 250 branches this year. We indicated we might do more; it's possible we won't now. We are going to be looking -- we are going to be relooking at a lot of businesses issues. Take branches, for example. With NSF/OD changing, with Durbin changing, with FDIC charges changing -- some branches the margins are no longer great. So we probably will reduce a little bit the branch build strategy. We still need to build branches in certain cities and particularly California, Florida, build out our footprint. But we will modify that and we will report back to you when we have that. But I would say the same thing about lots of products and services and issues. We are going to be taking a look at them. I'm not expecting anything dramatic; but obviously there's a lot of issues there when we are making so many changes all at once. Capital generation, dividend -- obviously a Board decision. Probably will take that up at the turn of the year. I would like to just see us do it kind of steady every year, but not much more than that. We are going to continue to invest in organic growth, but there are a lot of issues and a lot of analysts have raised it as -- which ones might you rethink? We will be back to you on that. So there are areas we know we are going to finish building out, and there are other areas we maybe look at how aggressive, what the price will be, and whether it still makes as much sense as before. But organic growth is an important thing that you can't stop/start -- i.e., hiring private bankers, training people, building systems. So we will still be doing some of that. The last box, which is kind of boxed there, it says -- meeting regulatory requirements and stock buyback. We still have -- we will have enormous capital generation, but we are trying to figure out -- I call it capital confusion. We have a lot -- it is hard to tell what we are supposed to do, how we are supposed to do it. And we will be figuring it out, having conversation with regulators. At one point that capital generation will be used fully to do what makes sense for shareholders. The question is how quickly we want to get to where we need to be. And there are other things, like there are new rules coming, risk-weighted assets models, models versus European companies, what mitigation we want. Some mitigation will take place and run off; some we can do more actively, but it would cost a little bit of money. Why do it quickly, if it would cost you money? So we are going to be talking more about this as we go forward. Obviously if you want to make the point, we spent the whole $8 billion buying back stock; and yes, it would have been wiser to wait. We are sorry. And with that I will open the floor to questions or comments. Oh, I am sorry page 17.
JAMIE DIMON: We tried to make this simple but -- Cramer? If you are on, Jim, I gather we didn't do a great job at it. So here is -- I am going to take you through the top. AFS securities, these are held by Treasury or by CIO often offset deposits or other things that we need to do for asset liability management. That $3.7 billion, if you market it, it would be about $3.4 billion. It is mostly sovereign exposure in the five countries, mostly obviously Italy and Spain. And we go back to potential losses in a second. Trading, $8.7 billion. Includes $14 billion of gross long derivative; then we offsets the other side. We have got collateral which is mostly cash, $6.7 billion against that. Sovereigns do not post collateral, so a lot of the remaining exposure is sovereign exposure. So think of it as 65% to sovereigns. Lending, the $7.9 billion is almost all corporate or bank. It is 75% corporate and probably about -- or a little more than -- maybe 80% corporate and 20% bank. Some of those banks by the way are very good banks, so we are not that worried about it. So if you actually look -- and a lot of this lending to corporate is large global multinationals. So -- and this number obviously bounces around as derivative values change and mark to markets change and collateral changes. But the $15 billion is what we have been managing to, kind of. And my -- if you said, if everything goes terribly and these countries default and the loss given default is 10%, 20%, 30% -- that is where we came up with $3 billion after-tax, which is $5 billion pretax. So you can do it yourself and go across the top. How much would you lose in a government security if they defaulted and it got restructured? And by the way there are other offsets and other positives not exactly on this page, and we can manage these exposures. So the reason we are doing this is because we do business with these countries. Again you know I mentioned capital confusion; I will mention banking confusion. Do we -- obviously, we have been doing business with these countries for 100 years. A lot of these clients -- you can't say you are going to be your bank one day and the second things get tough go away the next day. So we think we are earning some points, we are helping some companies, we are helping a few of the banks. And we hope the countries appreciate it. So we have decided to take this risk. Obviously we can change that on pretty quick notice if we wanted to. And we still think it is the right thing to do. I still don't expect the worst case in terms of our charge-offs in any event. So I will stop there and open the floor to questions or comments for Doug or myself. Questions and Answers
JAMIE DIMON: I think the way the Fed has set it up is that you can request; and as we go through our budget and stuff we are going to decide what to do. What we used to -- we used what we already had permission for them. And like I said, we have a lot of capital generation. The only question is when and how you use it, and how quickly you want to get up to the higher Basel III numbers. Do you want to get up there just by retaining capital or by waiting for mitigation and things like that? So we will be back to you on that. There is a lot of issues around that.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you are picking up a real change in tone. I think the fact is we don't know what the rest of the world is going to do. It is a little confusing about it. And I think the regulators need to give not just JPMorgan but the banking industry a little more guidance. Do they really mean you can leg into this over seven years? Or do they really mean they want you to do it right away? We can probably do it very quickly if we wanted to. I am not sure that is the right thing for the system. (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so let me take you to the most important thing. The United States has the best, deepest, widest, and most transparent capital markets in the world which give you, the investor, the ability to buy and sell large amounts at very cheap prices. That is a good thing. I wish Paul Volcker understood that. Okay? Now we understand why there is no proprietary trading. That was fine. And these are like -- I haven't read them all yet -- like 178 rules or reporting and compliance around what is proper market-making. We have to be in a position to do proper market-making for our clients. Most of our business is market-making. So there is going to be commentary. I think the commentary is going to come from the public, which includes you. I hope all of you on this phone understand how important this is, not just for your own business but for future of the United States. And we hope at the end of the day we will be able to make markets freely. If American companies are put at huge disadvantage, the foreign companies -- this is just -- we were told everyone is going to adopt this, which we know is not true. So now it would be even a bigger deal. So to me we have got to keep all these things in mind and make sure it ends up in the right place. We will be giving our comments to regulators, and I assume a lot of you will too at one point.
JAMIE DIMON: It's impossible to tell. These are just comments and rules and requirements, and it cuts across all of our parts of our Company. So they seem to be more prescriptive. I would have preferred to keep it simple. High capital -- which remember, they already doubled and tripled capital and liquidity on trading; and proper reporting and disclosure. But this is a little more prescriptive. It may make it a little bit harder. But let's let it work through the process before we have too many comments about it.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. So you talk about other -- the big European countries, okay? Obviously we have exposures to France, Germany, UK bigger than the ones we have in the ones in Italy and Spain. Large parts are also large corporates; so keep that in mind. Plus the sovereign credits are fine. So it's a whole different issue. The real issue you are talking about is now. Go to the bank -- obviously we do business with the banks, the larger global market counterparties which we track and monitor very carefully those exposures. Most of our exposures -- not all, but most of our exposures with global market counterparties are collateralized, sometimes with a bucket, and sometimes we have other tertiary exposures, something like that. So a couple of them are rather large, but not one of them would make me lose my -- because of a direct related, would we lose sleep. Most of them are -- most of them are in the couple hundred million dollars net-net-net. But remember, those bounce around. Derivative exposures bounce around. We also think most of those banks are actually quite sound. They have capital; they have got liquidity; they have got -- we think they will get some kind of -- if they need it, some kind of support. And what is needed in Europe, or are you talking about the United States?
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, Greece eventually has to be ring-fenced and restructured. But you don't want to do that disorderly, so that you don't cause a problem elsewhere. Eventually you are going to -- by using the ECB, the ESFS, and statements that Italy and Spain are solvent, they just need a little liquidity help -- which by the way is true. We believe they are quite solvent, and if they had their own central bank and they could print euro, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all. As you know they can't print euro, so they -- and they have central banks but they can't print in the euro currency. So in effect the ECB or someone else has to stand in as the central bank and provide liquidity. I think to do that you want other countries, France and Germany, to be very comfortable about -- I guess the final point is that some kind of restructuring of the treaty so people feel that they are not continuing, that no one is continuing to take advantage of a system that is flawed. I think that is all reasonable. And finally, I think some kind of national programs for TARP to support banks that need help; that is kind of belt and suspenders if you do the other stuff. But you obviously might see that too. If you did all those things, this crisis would be over. It's complex; you got 17 nations involved in it. So I am not saying it is simple. When I listen to politicians it sounds to me they have the will, just it is hard to find the way.
JAMIE DIMON: Go ahead, Doug.
JAMIE DIMON: Ed, different people have different things in their notes, so that is why some people are able to do it in a different way.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think we really changed the forecast. It is about $300 million, $350 million. There hasn't been a huge change in how they are doing it; but obviously we are paying attention to that just like you are. A little bit. We have -- we modeled into our numbers some of these factors anyway. So you have really got to look at -- is it different than what we modeled in? We still have $3.6 billion in reserves. At one point those reserves end up being excess, and we'll have to start taking those down too.
JAMIE DIMON: We settled some of those upfront.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me give you a broadband. First of all, we would love to have some kind of settlement. We think it is actually good for everybody to get some of that and move on, if it is reasonable. But there are 50 state AGs. It looks like it is getting bogged down. So we don't -- we will see. We are here, we are available, we'd like to work it out. Last quarter we did take higher servicing costs in the MSR. So go back to last quarter's numbers; we talked about it relating to the consent order and some of the default costs. And what was the other question?
JAMIE DIMON: Last quarter we put up $1 billion for a bunch of various items relating to a bunch of various items which we didn't disclose. Okay? Separate from the litigation reserves.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no. I am saying separate than the litigation reserves we put up some reserves for a whole bunch of other items related to a potential settlement.
JAMIE DIMON: Last quarter we did it.
JAMIE DIMON: I'd think so. I think so.
JAMIE DIMON: That is what I was referring to. Because obviously we can't stop the fourth quarter; but if you look at the business and you say -- okay, well, Durbin, NSF, that certain accounts no longer are profitable -- you might modify where you build branches, how you build branches. We are still going to build them in certain parts of the country because there is a lot of value in having market share in certain parts of the country. But going forward we are going to modify that branch plan when we have had a chance to look at the effect of all those things on new branch profitability.
JAMIE DIMON: We would expect it to go up. I mean we think you have seen -- some of what we had is mix. But if you look at the other people, they had it all go up a little bit too. But we don't expect it to go up from here. And then again you've got to do it by product, because there is some product that is a 90% and some product is quite a bit less.
JAMIE DIMON: So related to the five nations -- Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain -- the 6.7 -- whatever the counterparty risk is, that is financial institutions for the most part out -- but it's not in those five countries. So it is other counterparts. Okay? We do it name by name and person by person. Yes, it is diversified. And it is already in the numbers I gave you about the other banks. So if we said that we have a $100 million net exposure to X bank in Germany, it would include that counterpart exposure, and for the most part collateralized. So we feel pretty good about it. But obviously in a financial crisis these things could filter down. So you got to look at your primary risk, your secondary and tertiary, and all that. But it is done name by name day by day. And the CVA is just the mark to market on the receivable. So if we did a CDS with someone and they owed us $50 million, they are supposed to post collateral the next day. So we take the $50 million receivable. We mark it if the spreads go up to $55 million or something like that. And you get more collateral and so -- but it is every day. And a lot of the counterparts are names you know. They are global market counterparties. Some obviously reside in France and Germany, but plenty don't. And I said that reside France and Germany -- already in the exposures of those banks we are getting pretty much marking to market collateral every day. We do have some exposure to those banks that aren't that way; but that particular thing we do have mark to market every day.
JAMIE DIMON: The CVA is every single derivative credit exposure we have in the United States, overseas, Europe, Asia, of any type of derivative. Okay? So I would guess 30% is Europe and you can go country by country. So much is Asia and so much is the US. If you go by ratings a lot of those are highly rated counterparties. Remember we had this -- we also look at derivative exposure no different than credit exposure. We'd go to you and say -- we are going to give Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch a $100 million revolver. That is $100 million. We may give you a trade finance line of $100 million which you use or don't use. And we may give you a derivative line, which is not just what you owe us; it is also a stressed amount of what you owe us. And all of these things will be going to central clearinghouses soon -- or some of them will be over time.
JAMIE DIMON: The world went through this huge crisis with these counterparties, and it was really a very select few we had failures. Most of the major broker-dealers were able to manage their counterparty exposures rather well.
JAMIE DIMON: No. Remember first of all we look -- marketing is -- think of it as an investment. So there is a lot of analysis that takes place. You can get a return on it. And it is not all -- don't think of that as all direct mail. That is online marketing; it's -- and we have a lot of partners like United, Continental, Southwest Airlines, Hyatt and so they have requirements. So you see our ads in the paper all the time and stuff like that. So it really is a wide variety of stuff, and it is obviously a lumpy number. If you look at it year over year it will probably go up 10%, not like you have seen the 20% or 30% that it was this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know if they are accelerating things. We want to be prepared for whatever the rules are, and really are going to do the best job we can meeting all those regulatory requirements. So we are getting prepared. So like, certain things like LCR you know will be implemented. The calibrations may change over time, but the detail -- by type of deposit, by type of counterparty -- we're just going to have to do. So some we are starting to build just to get ahead of it. Volcker rules, we are not starting to build because it just came out. But some of the requirements like -- we already do. We may not do it exactly the way they want, but we already do it. We look at trading desks, and all the Greeks, and VARs, and aged inventory, and stuff like that. But they may have reporting requirements, compliance requirements will be heavier. So we are starting to build some of that, that we know is going to happen. I think the Volcker rules are meant to be done by January something. Comments go -- oh, comments are in by January. And then we -- I guess they will be some time after that. I think by the end of this year we're going to have a lot more guidance on a lot of these various rules and regulations and the coordination among them. In any event, we want to try to embed it in how we run the business so it is not a -- we are not chasing our tails; we know exactly what these things mean for our clients, our profitability, our trading desks, our loans, etc.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, the MSR, when rates go down and things refi it is like an I/O. It drops dramatically in value. So there is no surprise there. So what all this says, we hedged too well. That the drop in value was offset by the hedging we did. The other thing is that the total value is running off because of a higher amortization. That $1 billion write-down from last quarter, which really related to higher servicing costs, dropped the value of the MSR too. Okay? So if rates went up 100 basis points, the MSR gross value would go back from 7 to 10; and hopefully the hedge would -- well, actually, we wouldn't hedge at that point, so take the gain. But that is all that that is. There is constant adjustments to those models.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you have got to look at it by business. Because in some businesses you have competitive results like you have got to price certain deposits around the country retail competitively. Some of the large TSS deposits are already getting zero. We are not bidding for them; they are just coming to us and then we got to pay the FDIC 10 basis points on some of this too. So it is really a little bit of everything. But it is hard to go below zero, so that's why you get a little bit of this margin compression here.
JAMIE DIMON: I already said I'd put us in the more cautious outlook category.
JAMIE DIMON: I think it was both. I mean, if you went through -- go through the details in the statistical supplement; there are loans to NPLs and loans to charge-offs, delinquencies are very strong. I think it might be hard to keep them up here if it stays here. But like we said, it is hard not to be cautious now.
JAMIE DIMON: We showed you on that page, if you go to page 17, it shows gross derivative and net derivative. Okay? Is that what you are referring to? There are other exposures which are fully collateralized and I have been through them before; I don't want to go through them right here.
JAMIE DIMON: Betsy, honestly we have asked that question too, because the way the regulatory thing got upset they have this little GAAP issue. So we are waiting for guidance on that one, and I will just wait until we find out. The Board will take it up. I think we want to be consistent. I don't know if it is going to be 30% to 40%. It will be 30% with consistent growth.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I didn't say December. I said after the turn of the year. We started the dividend in June, right?
JAMIE DIMON: April. Before April.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know, Betsy; there is no change in strategy at all. We are still going to grow where we think we can gain share and build a very good business. And there is always -- your expenses come before your revenues. But like at a GCB, for example, we think it is working and we are perfectly willing to spend there. Other things I said we are going to -- we have to modify. There are whole products that we may not be in anymore if we look at exactly how they function with capital and liquidity charges. But we are going to be pretty tight on expenses. We are not being lax. We are just adding where we need to add; and then we always expect to get improvements in certain expense ratios as systems come on board, efficiencies -- operational efficiencies. Doug mentioned a big one. We are spending I think it was $800 million a quarter on Servicing now, which 65% is default servicing. Well, that number is not going to stay up there forever. Eventually that default service number will be -- it may take a couple years -- but close to zero. We also expect to make the front of the mortgage far more efficient, too. So we are always working on more efficiency to help pay for some of these other things.
JAMIE DIMON: So I guess -- see here is the problem with the G-SIFI. There are certain things -- we are not going to be uncompetitive, because we are going to price it in the market and get the business. If you are going to leave your money with us or them or a processing business, you are going to leave it with us; and then they are going to claim it is unfair. We hold more capital, we are going to win the business because we are more sound. Which I agree with them; I am not arguing their point. And other businesses, yes, we will probably want to shed the asset because someone else can hold it -- like take consumer assets. If you can hold it with 7% and I have to hold it for 9.5%, I still might service, originate, hold the strip I got -- the skin in the game strip; but syndicate the rest. So it will be product by product. It would be certain things. Certain of these things they want -- like one of the things in G-SIFI was to reduce interconnectedness. So they don't like interbank lending. I think interbank lending is going to go away. They don't like certain type of cross-border -- though it doesn't distinguish between secured and unsecured. But I think they have much higher charges for exposures to financial companies than nonfinancial companies. And that is not a terrible objective. It might not happen in a productive way; but you will see that people price lines of credit to financial companies much higher than lines of credit to nonfinancial companies. So I can go on and on. It will really relate to the specific rules, and that is the kind of work we are doing now. Some will cause unintended consequences that help JPMorgan, and some may very well cause unintended ones that hurt us. But in no event are we going to price it higher and get priced out of the market because of a G-SIFI charge. That is not going to happen. So whatever competitor told you that, tell them they shouldn't. They are not thinking clearly.
JAMIE DIMON: A little bit there, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: So we are not going to bring up quarterly -- monthly numbers for you. But my experience in Wall Street is as spreads gap out credit products, including mortgages and stuff like that, get hurt. So yes, I believe it happened in August.
JAMIE DIMON: There will runoff, and there will be decisions we make about what we want to do. The way Basel III is set up certain products have much higher capital charges than others. So we have choices and options to make. Over the next couple years certain things run off, or we can just sell things or hedge them differently and that could make a big difference. So, yes; we are going to manage the hell out of RWA.
JAMIE DIMON: That was my guess, Mike. I just think that when you look at G-SIFI, LCR -- I am not even including the consent order and mortgages here -- I think we are going to have to build a lot of additional systems by legal entity around the world to accommodate hundreds of new rules, regulation, reporting. I am just telling you that that would be my guess right now; that is all. We have real professional teams working today on 75 projects, and these are pretty large projects. They got risk, credit, legal systems, HR, sales traders, globally, by legal entity sometimes, trying to do it. There is liquidity reporting, credit reporting, new model building. And we are going to do it all well. We are going to do it all well. This is the New World; we're going to live with it. But it is hard to say it is not going to cost money.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, that is exactly right. That is exactly what I said.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, first a lot of the bad actors are gone, okay? So let's be fair here. If you talk to most clients of the -- I am talking about generic, not JPMorgan. Most of our clients like us. Our middle-market clients like us. We are doing a lot of small business. Our consumer clients -- even our mortgage clients. But we have issues, and obviously I think they get way over -- we should be responsive to them; I am not playing light of them. But if you travel around and spoke to clients everywhere, we are trying to do the best we can, like any other business. It is hard to make up for -- when you say change the image, if you have any great ideas on the phone you guys can write them up and send them to me. We'll take them into consideration.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know if that statement is completely true. But so I don't want to comment on something I am not sure about.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, if you are going to back DVA out of earnings -- which I think you should do; I completely understand that you normalize -- you should back it out of revenues, too. So $2 billion of that is DVA. Okay? So what we look at -- and again it is not -- which I think it is pretty good. Look at the underlying numbers, number of accounts, number of deposits, number of branches, number of clients, number of bankers. Keeping some kind of good trading flow in what seems to be a terrible environment. Market shares -- that is what I'd look at in terms of building the business. The revenues themselves are going to be lumpy. You and I have been in this business a long time, we know that. Obviously we are going to tighten -- trim our sails where we think there are products or areas or branches that we can't make any money at all. So obviously we are going to adjust to that. And a lot of that is going on right now. We acknowledge that.
JAMIE DIMON: It really is macro conservatism. If you look at delinquencies, roll rates, first-time delinquent, and all that kind of stuff they are kind of mixed. So it could very well start to improve again. But if it flattens out we are just -- abundance of caution on our part. The fact is the world questions them anyway about how these reserves -- are these reserves sufficient? Obviously there are multiple years covered chargeoffs today. They can cover a pretty adverse scenario at this point.
JAMIE DIMON: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was pretty much just all spreads and volume and not pipeline hedging profitability.
JAMIE DIMON: The pipeline would go against you in a quarter like this, when rates are dropping like that.
JAMIE DIMON: Mostly just true-ups that come through as you clean up -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: There are always going to be ins and outs every quarter, so it is going to move around. But right; low 30%s kind of normalized rate.
JAMIE DIMON: Also when profits go down, remember the rate goes down a little bit. Because at the margin you have more exempt income, slightly.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm going to pass it on to Doug -- a former investment banker.
JAMIE DIMON: I think our employees would get very upset if we said -- when the stock is high we will give you a lot of stock; and when you think it is low we will give you no stock.
JAMIE DIMON: (technical difficulty) we have not. And in general we have got -- you know, it's by product, by area, by everything. But general, what's modeled into our reserves and our purchase credit [period] is another drop of 1% to 4% depending what it is.
JAMIE DIMON: It still seems that that may actually be what ends up happening. But as you know as well we do, we don't know that exactly.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, that is a very good question. So I should have put at that bottom of that capital thing, when I talk about capital confusion, that is another one. So there are some wonderful things you can buy now that we can probably get a 10% or 11% cash-on-cash return for probably with a duration of three or four years, that is being dumped by other people. But it's got those very, very high RWA -- not like 100%; like 1,200% type charges. But it is kind of mouthwatering. So we are trying -- that is why I am saying when we reinvest our portfolio we do have options. But it all comes down to how we want to make those decisions. We are making them right now as we go along; we want to think it through a little bit better. But there will be opportunities, and we are willing to use our capital to do that. (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: No, it won't all happen in fourth. I am talking about we expect that maybe -- I would say over the next six or nine months (multiple speakers). But you would ask the next question, which you would want to ask, which is okay. Would you rather buy 11% RWA -- 11% cash-on-cash asset with such a [large] RWA that you get back, or buy your stock back much cheaper?
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not going to tell you. I will just tell you there is a little bit of a dilemma; and then it relates to whether you can or not. We know we can buy the assets. We are not sure we can buy back the stock.
JAMIE DIMON: And we know we can buy the asset and also have a huge lift in Basel III when we want it, because it will disappear by that point. That is why I am saying it is a little bit around this capital confusion.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, I think you're going too far [in]. First of all I would simply say that obviously when we do these things we talk to the accountants. And there are judgment calls and analysis -- in fact you're always updating when we do these things. For example I pointed out before on seconds, behind a delinquent first, we are much different in how we look at that than seconds not behind a delinquent first. So we do much more sophisticated reserving than that. But I made it very clear we are going to be as conservative as possible. Maybe next quarter I am going to be saying we had to take this down because we were forced to.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think so. I think it is just the facts are constantly changing and you have got to talk to some of the accountants, get their opinion on it. I think you are stretching to say it would be that.
JAMIE DIMON: Doug may know the number. We disclosed the number last time? What was that (multiple speakers)?
JAMIE DIMON: If the curve went up today 100 basis points -- I remember the last time I looked at it, it is about 50/50 of the short and long. They both would benefit the Company.
JAMIE DIMON: Excuse me?
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, so first of all the correspondent issue is not a big deal; so put that to the side. Okay? That is really basically buying servicing, which to me is a pure economic decision. Are you buying at a good return or not? And some of them are clients; so we treat correspondent clients -- like banks who also have broad relationships with us -- very differently regional banks, etc. But we are going to be obviously going through that again too. I think a couple years ago we cut the correspondent thing literally a third of what it was. I look at it the other way around. I think that we will have going forward one of the best mortgage businesses in the country. Okay? Because we intend to build the best front-end middle-office back-office systems. Eventually the legacy problems will be gone. We think -- we know we made a lot of mistakes here, so we are not denying that. We have made them in other businesses too every now and then. And we have real competitive distribution -- 5,300 branches, salespeople, a mortgage sales force. So we think it will still be a really important product which -- no matter, whatever happens to GSEs have an embedded profit built into it. And all the legacy stuff will be sunk cost. In fact all the underwriting for the last three years is back to where it was like 30 years ago. In fact, going forward it is going to be a much better business. Cleaner. You won't have all these problems from the past. So we are in favor of cleaning up the mortgage product, disclosures, national regulation. So that will make it better. But I think it would be a mistake to say -- okay, we are going to get out of it because of the legacy problems. Believe me, there is a temptation. Okay? Like we are still making $10 billion, $12 million, $13 billion in mortgages a month, a lot of it in states where we are being attacked by AGs. We know we made mistakes. We want to resolve the mistakes, and we are willing to be punished for the mistakes. But I think that is the wrong reason to get out of the business for. It is too important. It is still the most important financial product for the majority of Americans, and it will be for the rest of our lives.
JAMIE DIMON: Additive. This is just like a static analysis.
JAMIE DIMON: (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible).
JAMIE DIMON: First of all I think they have been very clear about their policy and why they have a policy and all that. It was a real tool for them. We do have a lot of money parked there because there is a lot of money swishing around the world that has no place to go. We would have other alternatives that, my guess, we would get a lot of that back anyway, but you have to take some risk to do. Some things would be 10 -- the Fed is 25, some will be 10, some will be 15. There are options around the world at other central banks at higher rates. We can turn down deposits; we can -we don't want to go negative on deposits, but we could do that too if we had to.
JAMIE DIMON: We're trying to accommodate our clients more than -- the reason we are taking some of those is to be accommodative not to make a spread. Remember our spread for most of these things is not -- even if it is at the Fed it is not 25 basis points. It's 15.
JAMIE DIMON: The FDIC charge.
JAMIE DIMON: Honestly, if you're asking, why do you do it at all?
JAMIE DIMON: You wouldn't want a business to earn 15 basis points.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me -- first of all wholesale credit is exceptionally good. It is better than -- it is almost back to where -- I'm talking about large corporate, middle-market. So we were talking about consumer when we said delinquency trends kind of flattened out. On credit card there is no -- there is a little bit of flattening out in there, in their 30-, 60-, 90-day delinquencies; but no other major thing. So what we said about charge-offs, they will probably tick down a little bit next quarter. It is very hard to tell what they are going to be next year. We always have a lot of visibility into the next quarter. But you know, I think with 9% unemployment it will be silly to assume dramatic improvement at this point.
JAMIE DIMON: Almost none of that number is Greece.
JAMIE DIMON: I already commented on that, so I am not going to do it again. But we have talked about it extensively, and actually there is some great research about it. So if you want you can call Lauren and she can send it on to you.
JAMIE DIMON: Doug?
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks for listening to us. We'll talk to you all soon.",0.08999999999999997,-0.09600000000000032,0,0.09095671706342437,0.12852206883230516
20,Q3_2017,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO & EXECUTIVE VP, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. The third quarter was generally constructive across businesses and asset classes. Underlying business drivers grew broadly, and we maintained or gained share in a competitive environment. The U.S. and global economy continue to grow. Clients are active, with demand for credit remaining solid. All in all, resulting in 7% growth in net income, driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rises and expense remains controlled. On an adjusted basis, this is a clear record for a third quarter. Of course, against this financial backdrop, I want to acknowledge the recent natural disasters. The impact on affected customers, communities and employees have been devastating, and supporting them is our priority as they rebuild. I will note that any financial impact is not significant to our results. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.76 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $26.2 billion. Highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 7.5% year-on-year. And the FDIC recently released its survey, showing that the firm has surpassed the competition and now ranks #1 in total U.S. deposits and in deposit growth, driven by strong consumer deposit growth, up 9%. Client investment assets, credit card sales and merchant volumes were all up 13%, and we continue to rank #1 in global IBCs. We have record revenue in the Commercial Bank and delivered record net income and assets under management in Asset & Wealth Management. The credit environment continues to remain benign across products and portfolios. Card charge-offs were fully in line with our expectations and guidance. And outside of Card, our charge-off rates remain at historically low levels. Now turning to Page 2 and some more detail about the third quarter. Revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year, driven by net interest income, up $1.2 billion, reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued loan growth, partially offset by lower markets revenue. Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was flat to last quarter and to last year if you exclude $175 million of onetime items in CCB in the prior year period. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up about $200 million year-on-year, driven by higher net charge-offs in Card. And in the quarter, we built Card reserves of $300 million, primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages. And we saw a Wholesale release of over $100 million, partly driven by select names in the energy sector and reflecting improvements in portfolio quality in commercial real estate. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. What is most notable on this page is that all of the numbers are basically flat quarter-on-quarter with the exception of growth in tangible book value per share as capital generation was fully offset by distributions, reflecting a payout of above 100% for the first time in a long time, in line with our approved capital plan. And from here, we expect the direction of travel for our CET1 ratio to be lower over time. Moving on to Page 4 on Consumer and Community Banking. CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continue to grow core loans, up 8% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 12%. And Business Banking, Card and Auto loans and leases were each up 7%. Year-on-year, we saw 13% growth in each of client investment assets, card sales and merchant processing volumes. Nearly half of the growth in investment assets came from net inflows. And our deposit margin continued to expand, up 6 basis points this quarter. Revenue of $12 billion was up 6% year-on-year. Consumer and Business Banking revenue was up 15% on higher NII, approximately equally due to margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was down 17% on loan spreads and production margin compression as well as lower net servicing revenue driven by the MSR. Underlying that decline, the mortgage business is performing well relative to the market. Our originations are down only 1% versus the market down an estimated 15% as we gained share in purchase. Finishing up on revenue. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up 7% as higher auto lease income and growth in card loan balances outpaced the continued impact of investments in new account acquisitions. Expect CCSA fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire Reserve last year. Expense of $6.5 billion was flat year-on-year, or up 3% excluding the onetime items I mentioned. Higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth are partially offset by lower marketing expense. The overhead ratio was 54% for the quarter as positive operating leverage, despite significant investments in the business, moves us closer to our medium-term target. Finally, on credit performance. In terms of net charge-offs, as I said, Card increased in line with expectations and guidance. And in Auto, charge-offs included approximately $50 million of a catch-up, reflecting regulatory guidance on the treatment of customer bankruptcies. Excluding this, the loss rate in Auto was only 41 basis points. In general, it feels like the auto market has plateaued at current levels, with inventory, incentives, used car prices and SAR all having stabilized over the last few months. And in terms of credit reserves, as previously mentioned, we built $300 million in Card reserves in the quarter as we grow. And although there were no mortgage reserve actions, portfolio quality improvements allowed us to absorb the expected impact of the hurricanes into our current reserves. Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. The third quarter of 2016 revenue in both IBC's end markets benefited from a number of large-fee events and higher levels of volatility, creating tough comparisons across the board. This quarter in banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was strong and relatively flat from last year's record levels. Year-to-date, we've gained some share and maintained our #1 ranking in global IBCs. We also ranked #1 in North America and EMEA. We printed record advisory fees for third quarter, up 14% on broad strength across sectors and deal sizes, particularly in Europe, making up for a smaller wallet in North America. And equity underwriting fees were down 21%. However, we ranked #1 in wallet, number of deals and volumes globally for the quarter and for the year-to-date. The market remains active and the pipeline healthy. And in debt underwriting, there was a reasonably high run rate coming into the quarter, and we broadly maintained it. Landing fee is slightly down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, driven by strong repricing and refinancing activity and high-yield bond issuance. We ranked #1 in fees year-to-date and gained share overall and across products. Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 15%. And while higher rates are a driver, we are also seeing positive momentum in organic growth in the business globally as our clients are responding favorably to the investments we've made in our platform and products. Moving on to markets. Total revenue was $4.5 billion, down 21% year-on-year against an impressive third quarter of 2016 and a quieter and very competitive environment. Fixed income revenue was down 27%, a solid performance given a backdrop of low volatility and tight spreads. And at the risk of laboring the point, you may recall that we gained 240 basis points a share in FICC in the third quarter of '16, which will mean our year-on-year decline will look larger than most. Equities revenue was down 4%, but underneath that is a diversification story. Consistent with last quarter, lower flow in exotic derivatives activity was substantially offset by strength in cash and prime, which continue to be a bright spot for us this year. Before I move on, the fourth quarter environment so far feels consistent with the second and third, with no obvious catalysts on the horizons about to change. But of course, change occurred. So it's worth pointing out that the fourth quarter last year was also a record for a fourth quarter since the crisis. And as such, we expect next quarter's markets revenues to be lower year-on-year. Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was up 10%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 15% year-on-year, as well as by higher asset-based fees on market levels globally. Finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower compensation expense on lower revenues. And the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Another excellent quarter in this business with net income of $881 million, with record revenue and an ROE of 17%. And although we recognize that our results are affected by a benign credit environment, the performance is very strong and broad-based and is driven by the investments we've been making in the business, the differentiated platform capabilities we can offer our clients and our commitment to business discipline. Revenue grew 15% year-on-year, driven by deposit NII and on higher loan balances, with overall spreads remaining steady. And while IB revenue was down some year-on-year, we grew 9% sequentially, with particular strength in middle market, which is starting to feel like a trend. Expense of $800 million was up 7% on continued investment in the business focused on technology as well as banker coverage, having added over 200 bankers since the beginning of 2016. And since our investment agenda is ongoing, expect fourth quarter expenses to remain at about this level. Loan balances were up 10% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 8% year-on-year, driven by strength in expansion markets and specialized industries, but were flat sequentially, in line with the industry, on flat utilization despite decent deal flow and stable pipelines. Commercial real estate saw growth of 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. And although growth rates are decelerating, we continue to outpace the industry. However, we remain very disciplined in client selection, products and pricing and are sticking to what we know well. Finally, credit costs were a benefit of $47 million, predominantly driven by commercial real estate. Credit performance remains strong, with a net charge-off rate of 4 basis points. Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported record net income of $674 million with pretax margin of 33% and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and by strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by a combination of higher compensation and higher external fees, for which there is an offset in revenue. This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $21 billion, with positive flows across fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We also saw net liquidity inflows of $5 billion and continued to increase our global market share. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were up 10% and 9%, respectively, year-on-year on higher market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 4% sequentially, reflecting continued migration from deposit accounts into investment-related assets, and we are retaining the vast majority of these balances. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 10% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 19%. Moving to Page 8 and corporate. Corporate posted net income of $78 million. Treasury and CIO's results improved year-on-year, primarily due to the benefit of higher rates. And you'll remember that last quarter, Other Corporate included a legal benefit, which is driving the quarter-on-quarter decline you see on the page. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. All of NII expense, charge-offs and loan growth remain broadly in line with previous guidance. So to wrap up, this quarter and this year, we continue to consistently deliver for our clients. Our businesses are performing strongly across the board, maintaining or gaining share. Our financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform, the benefits of diversification and of scale as well as an investment strategy focused on long-term growth and profitability. We remain very well positioned to continue to benefit in a growing global economy. Operator, we can open up the line for questions. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: So Betsy, there's no change in our transfer pricing methodology or even the way we compute it. It's to do, as you appreciate, with, obviously, higher rates and the fact that we are in a very disciplined environment at this point on deposit reprice. We would expect to continue to see the margin expand over the course of the next several quarters, but we would also expect to continue to drive higher NII as we're growing our deposits. [And those remain] in FTP.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, I think the way to think about it, not to sort of diminish the importance of any individual breach or situation, is that we are, honestly, under constant attack both in a more general side, but also from a fraud perspective. And so while we will always react and learn lessons from every individual situation, this is not the first breach, nor will it be the last breach. And so as a result, we have been constantly evolving and refining the way we think about fraud prevention, detection, underwriting, continuing to move to multifactor protocols around customer identification, looking to leverage all of our data to sort of better inform our underwriting decisions. So the reality is that, as important as it is and as much as we -- as each individual breach could impact the overall equation, we have had to evolve over an extended period to the position that we're in now. And so as a direct result of this, there won't be specific, meaningful changes, but a continuous evolution. And so when we are looking whether it's at sending out preapprovals or marketing offers or receiving inbound applications, we are increasingly looking at a number of different data points and facts to be able to identify the customer and understand the application.
MARIANNE LAKE: And the reality, Betsy, is that we kind of operated over an extended period now on the presumption that while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others either right now that we don't know about or over time. And so we have to be proactive, not reactive. And we'll obviously look to learn anything we can, but we continue to evolve so that we can use all of the information at our fingertips. And as a practical matter, we are not seeing a specific increase in fraud.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct, correct. As a result, we're already spending the money that we need to spend to keep, hopefully, ahead of the curve on all of these things. Our operating losses are -- I will say, the combination of all of the information that has been compromised over the course of the last several years has put pressure on fraud costs, but nothing incremental from this. And so no impact on expenses or loan growth that would be measurable.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, we -- obviously, apart from the rate hike in June, nothing has really happened much since last quarter. And so the landscape is looking pretty similar, and -- not because that's surprising, so I'll come back to that in a second, which is to say that there's been very little to no movement in the repricing of deposit accounts. There's been some incremental movements in certain savings and CDs, but nothing systematic in the consumer space. But that's pretty much as we would have expected with rates at these absolute levels. And so at some point in time, and that may be a couple, 3 more rate hikes from now, the dynamic may start to change, and so we haven't changed our perspective about what we think the ultimate reprice will look like. In Asset & Wealth Management, the story on deposit pricing is somewhat similar. A little bit more movement, but nothing particularly meaningful or dramatic. The story there is very much, again, as expected. At these levels of rates, you are seeing customers start to make choices to move certain of their deposit balances into investment assets. That's normal migration, migration that we expected and that we've modeled, and we are retaining those balances. So we are starting to see some of the dynamics we expected play out. That started happening at the beginning of the year and has continued to progress. And then in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well. So I would start with we're firmly on a reprice journey in wholesale, no doubt. And depending on where you are in the spectrum, it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies, where the reprice is modest, but present to the higher end, where it's reasonably high. And so overall, if I step back, that's where we are. If I step back and say, ""Have we learned something new in this cycle that we didn't know?"" The answer is, ""No, not really."" If you look at the first 4 rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit reprice was pretty much the same as it is now. So we continue to believe that the dynamics that we've been talking about over the last several years and that we've expected will play out. They may not play out exactly as we have them modeled, but they will ultimately play out that way and that we have appropriately conservative reprice assumptions.
MARIANNE LAKE: So at the risk of sort of hedging, it's actually a bit of both. The reality is there's always been 2 different camps on the reprice theories for consumer. There's been the camp of acute market awareness, low for long, technology enhancements allow movement of money to be easier, competition for retail deposits and good liquidity deposit is high. Therefore, reprice higher. And the counter to that, which has merit and which we are seeing to a degree, is customers feel that they're weighing a more balanced scorecard of things when they choose where to keep their deposits. And customer satisfaction, the suite of products and simplicity, the digital and online offerings as well as the safety, security and brand all matter and that price is a factor, but not the only one. So I would say we certainly feel that having a leading digital capability is critical to, overall, our customer franchise, and it will, in all likelihood, have an impact on the stickiness of deposits because customers value that kind of convenience very highly. I would also say one other thing about where we are right now, is that, as you know, as much as you're right about the sort of potential demand for these sort of high-liquidity value deposits, there's a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system. And although loan growth is solid, it's solid. So we aren't seeing a frenzy, albeit that we're very proud of our deposit growth.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, welcome back.
MARIANNE LAKE: I don't have that off the top of my head, but we can get back to you.
MARIANNE LAKE: I fear -- here's what we'll do. I fear if I give you a ballpark, I'll get it wrong. While we're on the call, we'll get someone to send the details and let you know.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we're doing a bit of all of the above. So I'll start with the comment which you heard from us before, but which we still strongly defend, which is that branches still matter. That 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches. That, on average, a customer comes into our branches multiple times in a quarter. So I know that all sounds like old news, but it's still new news at -- or current news. So the branch distribution network matters. Customer preferences are changing, and we are not being complacent to that. So we are, underneath the overall 5,000-plus branches, continuing to consolidate, close, move, grow, change all of our branches in line with the opportunity in the market that we're in. So net for the year, we'll be down about 125 branches. We've closed more than that, consolidated some and added some. So we're not being complacent to the consumer preference story. But branches still matter a lot, and we're building out all of the other sort of omni-channel pieces, as you know, so that we have the complete offering. And if the customer behaviors start changing in a more accelerated fashion, we will respond accordingly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would characterize this as -- over the 2 quarters of normal. So you may recall last quarter, there were a couple of things that we talked about. First was that there was a $75 million sort of onetime interest adjustment in mortgage, which artificially reduced loan yields for the quarter. And secondly, that seasonality and mix in Card similarly. So we would normally, in the law of extraordinarily big numbers, expect for a 25 basis point rate hike that we'd see about 10-ish basis points of improvement in loan yields across the whole portfolio. We didn't see that last quarter. What you're seeing this quarter is the reversal of those factors and the normal benefit of the June rate hike.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So as we look at the loss rates for this year, they're coming in, as we expected, at less than 3%. And as we look out to next year, based on what we know today, it's still in that 3% to 3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range. So it's broadly in line with our expectations. So the reserve build -- and we -- in the consumer space, we move our reserves in -- not in dollar increments. But the reserve build is about a little less than 1/3 on the growth and a little more than 2/3 on normalization of rate.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So -- yes, NII, so a couple of things. The first is just to sort of repeat the standard. Just as a sort of macro matter, we're more sensitive to the front end of rates than to the long end of rates, particularly over any short period of time. And so intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year, while it's not nothing, it's not like it would have a material impact on the run rate. We're -- clearly, an overall generally flatter long end of the curve, in general, on average, through the year, all other things being equal, will have had a dampening pressure on our expectations. And it's part of the reason why they went from 4.5% to 4%, not the only one, as we progress through the year. But generally speaking, intra-quarter volatility is not something that would have a meaningful impact on our run rate.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So on the first, I think it's quite important to, like, not look at the average and to kind of decompose it into constituent parts. Because we've talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in CIB, but loan growth is not really a thing there. And so this quarter, we saw no loan growth in CIB. So no big deal, but it means that, that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been, outside of CIB, closer to 9%. So start with that. Consumer has been pretty consistent. So across the consumer space, whether it's our jumbo mortgages, whether it's the Business Banking, Card, Auto loans and leases, they've been growing at reasonably solid and consistent high single-digit territory or even low double digit for mortgage over the last several quarters. And at this point, we don't really see anything that is suggesting that, that will moderate meaningfully. So where you're seeing -- and similarly, in Asset & Wealth Management on the banking side. So really, where you're seeing the growth moderate is in commercial, and it's in both the C&I loans and the commercial real estate loans. And they each have a story. With the commercial -- with the C&I loans, for us, the story is about moving from meaningfully outperforming the industry to being more in line with the industry. So over the course of the last couple of years, as we've added expansion market, opened new offices, added a couple hundred bankers, developed our specialized industry coverage models, we've been growing meaningfully better than the industry. And so you see that even in this quarter in our year-on-year growth, 8%, as compared to the quarter-on-quarter growth, where it is flatter. And that, to me, is really a factor of the fact that in this stage of the cycle, our clients have strong balance sheets. They have a lot of liquidity. They have had access to the capital market. And so GDP-plus growth is not unlikely to be a level for the foreseeable future. With commercial real estate, it's slightly different. We're still outpacing the industry, but we've kind of gone from very strong to strong, and we would continue to expect that to slowly moderate. And that's a number of things. It's some higher rates. It's actually a lot of competition. And then it's a lot also about client selectivity given where we are in the cycle. So we are being very cautious about new deals that we add to the pipeline and the client selection that we have. So all of those factors, I think, weigh into the commercial real estate space. Just -- tax reform, so fiscal stimulus. The reality right now is, although I think everyone and ourselves included are hopeful, obviously, that tax reform is done for the right reasons and that the economy responds accordingly, at this point, it's not front and center in the dialogue we're having with our clients about whether they should or shouldn't do a strategic deal or take an action. So I would say it's neither holding up business, nor spurring business, but that could change. So at this point, I'd say it's a factor, but not a driving factor, and that could change.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, so -- I mean, we'll just deal with the fourth quarter because I think the landscape of rate hikes for 2018 is an open question. But no, we would expect loan yields to hold relatively flat, all other things being equal. It's a very competitive environment. We aren't seeing -- we're seeing some pressure in commercial real estate spreads. We're seeing, generally, spreads holding up. But I would expect competitive pressures to keep loan yields relatively flat.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So we are -- at this point, we are, at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3% to 3.25% next year and growing, so you should continue to expect that we'll be adding to reserves. Our outlook for reserve adds next quarter is below this quarter. But obviously, we will continue to observe that. And with respect to the hurricanes, right now, in this quarter's results, in the credit lines, in mortgage particularly, and to a much lesser degree, in wholesale, we built -- effectively built $55 million of reserves. To sort of contextualize that, we have used our unfortunate experiences of Sandy and Andrew and other natural disasters to calibrate the assumptions we're using. At this point, it's early to be able to say how the losses will actually manifest themselves. It could be that it's lower than that, but that's also the central case right now, $50 million in mortgage and just a handful of million in the wholesale space.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I'll just start with a bit of a philosophical discussion, which is it is our opinion that now, as much, if not more so than ever, the investments we're making in technology will effectively breed and deliver the efficiency. So to the degree that we are able to find incremental investments or accelerate them, we'll be willing to do that. And our expense numbers, our outlook has never -- have never been target. So that's just a sort of mental -- philosophical point of view that we would deliver any technology innovation and investments that we could execute well, that we think would be either accretive to our returns through revenues or efficiency. Specifically, when you look at the simulation, this is a point of technicality. In 2018, middle -- probably middle to third quarter of 2018, we are expecting that the FDIC DIF fund will reach its level at which the surcharge will be able to be reduced. That's a meaningful positive for us. And so if you look at the implied growth in expenses from '17 through the medium term, they are larger than is implied. But if we found the opportunity to do more or to accelerate more, we would do it and explain it to you. So we'll come back to that at Investor Day.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I think I'm -- so when we did some conferences at the end of the last year, I think that we said that we'd expect the revenue rates for the full year this year to be 10.5%, and it will be a little better than that. And the revenue rate increase in the quarter speaks to a little bit of spread and a little bit of lower premium. It will go down the next quarter because of the fourth quarter effect of the Sapphire Reserve travel credit for overall, call it, 10.6% for the year. But yes, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year. And we've reached the inflection point end of the third -- second quarter and into the third quarter, where growth is offsetting the impacts of the significant upfront investments in Sapphire Reserve. Then we'll see revenues grew from here.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I'll just start with credit for a second because although we absolutely expect at some point that we're going to see normalization of credit -- we haven't seen that yet, I just want to make that clear, that we are appropriately cautious in sharing everything, but we're not seeing any deterioration or any thematic fragility in our portfolio that we're concerned about at this point. With respect to the revenue side of the story and the efficiency side, I mean, it really is a story of all of the things you mentioned sort of all coming together at the same time. So we have been adding to -- we have our expansion markets from the Walmart acquisition. We've been adding new markets and opening offices. We've been adding bankers. And as you know...
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. We are in all 50 of our top MSAs now. And we've been adding bankers. And as you know, when you add all of these investments, for a period of time, when they are still in the buildup mode, you don't see that drop to the bottom line or to the top line. And now we're starting to see our bankers hit their stride, become very productive, the balances are building. And then I would also say that this is a -- the epicenter of delivering the whole platform to our clients. So if you think about what we're able to offer our clients in terms of international capabilities, banking coverage across industries, core cash, global payments, we have a platform offering, I think, that is -- well, it's certainly complete, and it's somewhat differentiated. And then the third thing I would say is that it's a buttoned-up business. We have been looking at efficiency and expenses and really working on making sure that due to simplification processes that we went through in 2013, '14 and '15, that we are focusing all of our efforts on our core strategic clients, and it's paying off.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say it's almost -- like you said, there are so many uncertainties that it's almost talking about hypothetical at this point, as encouraged as we are with the ongoing dialogue. My view is sentiment is relatively high. In fact, it's ticked up slightly over the course of the last short while. So from that vantage point, we're in a position of strength. And there would necessarily be some lag, so whether that is a couple of quarters or longer. So certainly, in the foreseeable future, you would hope to be able to see increased demand and confidence leading to action.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I'll start with the excess liquidity question because while we feel very, very good about our liquidity position, and you will have seen in the recent disclosures where everyone is positioned and necessarily, even if LCR was the only consideration, people would want to be running a Basel II LCR. So -- but LCR is not the only consideration. And the other most notable one I would point out to you would be resolution planning. So know that when we have our overall liquidity position, we're taking into consideration a combination of constraints. And so what may look excess in one -- on one lever may not be as excess on another. The second I would say is that when we look at the deployment of our HQLA, we look at it in the context of our sort of target for what we want the duration of equity for the company to be over the course of the normalization in rates. And obviously, it's not just about liquidity. It's also about duration. So we're comfortable with our liquidity position. We have a framework for deploying it and for thinking about the spot and forward-looking duration of the company. That's not to say that we are not opportunistic in taking advantage of moves that are technical in the long end of rates to either deploy or to undeploy dry powder, and we still have some. So it's more than just liquidity. It's also duration, and we've taken the overall balance sheet and our expectations and our target into consideration, albeit that we still have some dry powder.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it will be over the short while, and our full expectation outside of any other, like, stimulation is that as the front end of rates goes up and as gradual QE unwind happens, that you're going to see the long end of rates go up, albeit more slowly. So it's pretty typical at this point in the normalization cycle to have a curve flattened. That's what we're seeing. That's what we would expect. I would expect to continue to see the long end rise. And yes, it should be NIM-accretive.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say it's wallet share. It's blocking and tackling. We did pretty well in Europe, and -but there is still a lot of competition. So I would say it's less about the specifics of any one competitor because the environment is pretty competitive and just about sort of reasonably broad strength. Two things that I would also point out is, the first, in equity underwriting, similar to -- in FICC, we gained a couple hundred basis points a share in the third quarter of last year. So on an apples-to-apples basis to where we would normally expect our shares to be, we're still doing very well.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, that was a lot. So look, first of all, we welcomed the report. And it's a long report, a couple hundred pages. There's a lot of recommendations, very comprehensive. So kudos to the Treasury for delivering it. And we are supportive of those recommendations kind of at large. And I think the most important thing to remind you is that this is not about materially changing the legislative landscape. It's about recalibrating -sensibly recalibrating the specifics of individual rules over time. And so we're still digesting the report, but we are supportive. It is very comprehensive, and it could be very beneficial to the liquidity and depth of the capital market, which is what we should all hope for and not contrary to safety and soundness. So in that sense, very supportive, all good. It's going to be complicated, and it will take time, but the will is there. And so whether it's the administration or the regulators, there's a general recognition that there's the ability and the appetite to want to make rational change. And so if that helps to grow the economy and all the things that come with that, we're working as constructively as we can on that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we have a fairly large mortgage loan portfolio in addition to having a large portfolio in our investment securities in MBS. So we are already reasonably equivalently mixed in terms of our percentage of mortgage exposure to our total assets or loans to the competitive landscape. And so trust me when I tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of LCR and we are thinking about more than just LCR. And we do -- as I said, while we do maintain a short position and the cost of being short is relatively cheap, we don't have the kind of capacity to invest $100-plus billion in MBS right now or anything that's meaningful like that to generate higher returns without blowing through our duration target.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, no, no. We haven't. We -- as we talked about before -- a while ago, we made some surgical changes to our credit box in the Card space, but that's, if anything, I would say, incredibly granular, incredibly surgically tightening, not the reverse. Whether that's in Card, in certain micro sales or whether that's in Auto, I would say we've been pretty conservative. And we're probably doing, at the very margin, a little bit of tightening.
MARIANNE LAKE: No. So I mean, congratulations to them if they have a high degree of confidence on what 2018 CCAR is going to look like. So I will tell you this. We said very clearly that we feel that the company should operate within the range of 11% to 12.5%. We feel like it should be lower in that range. And having a capital plan approved of $19.4 billion of share buybacks over the next 4 quarters and over 100% payout based on analyst estimates is a start. So nothing has changed about that objective, but we would want to be measured about the pace at which we do it until we have a bit more final clarity on what the new generation of capital rules will look like. So we hopefully will know more as we go into the next cycle of capital planning. We haven't changed our point of view that we should be able to continue that journey down into the range, and that would be our objective. To tell you that we can give you the road map for that today, I think, is not accurate. So -- but you can do your -you can and you have done your own math. You can -- your base -- look at our earning outlook in your earnings models and payouts of over 100%, and you can see that we can move down in that same time frame to something much lower than we are now. It's not towards the bottom, but that's not to say that we will be able to do that. We need to go through tests.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I think I got that. So the compliance burden and the readiness and the work to be ready is a significant heavy lift not just for us, but, as you say, for all market participants. And so there is the possibility that effective at the beginning of the year, there will be ongoing work that needs to get done. We feel like we're reasonably well positioned and -- to defend our position. But there's no doubt that over the course of the year and beyond that people get clearer and clearer on transparency and cost to execute versus advice versus content that there may be competitive dynamics to change. And we feel like we've been building for the last several years to be ready for those dynamics. So there could be some bumps. I don't think it's anything that we're concerned about at this point, and we will all learn a little more as we go through 2018.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say that, for sure, has to be part of it. And even with the auto situation, what you're seeing is, I think, a marketplace that is much more responsive. So while we felt like we got ahead of the issues and tightened early, you've seen the sort of industry generally move in that direction. So I think there's no doubt that the environment, in totality, sort of capital liquidity controls regulation has led to higher-quality loan books. And so yes, we have been pressure-tested. Energy was a 1 in 100-year flood. And I think the industry, and specifically our portfolio, performed really quite well. And that's not to say that there isn't a point of pain out there somewhere we just -- that we won't see. We just feel like we'll be in a good position to get through that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, but no. Yes, (inaudible). So I would tell you that we are seeing that rotation start. If you go back even 3 years ago, we kind of gave you an outline of what we thought would happen. We said we're going to see rotations from the high wealth segment into investment assets, followed ultimately by the consumer space. We'll see retail deposits move into money funds. We'll see outflows of wholesale, not deposits, as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet. But those things are going to play out over the course of the next -- depending on the rate cut, over the course of the next 2 to 4 years. So we've begun to see it. It should be expected. I don't think it tells us anything new or different necessarily at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong. So when we say moderated, it's from very strong to very strong. And it is in part due to the number of new products we've had. So we would continue -- the Sapphire Reserve card spend engagement is very strong, and we're very pleased with it. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's a moderation necessarily. It's just, at these very high levels, from a slightly higher to very strong is still a great story.
MARIANNE LAKE: So if you think about -- our first acquisitions were in August and September. So we're kind of at the early stages. So far, very encouraging. So far, better than our expectations. But a little early to sort of draw firm conclusions on it, but very encouraging.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. Thank you, everyone.",0.09000000000000008,0.6050000000000013,1,0.08836065236180445,0.11385583979278671
21,Q3_2016,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1 and taking a look at the quarter we had strong performance in each of our businesses despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. Bringing it all together this quarter's result was clean with no significant items and with the firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.58 and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.5 billion of revenue. Highlights of the quarter include the highest reported revenue for a third quarter in CIB with IBCs up 15% and markets revenues up 33% with strong performance across the board. Robust core loan growth for the Company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses. And the continuation of strong credit performance including a net release for Oil & Gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year on year and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. Finally, we had record consumer deposit growth up 11%. Before I move on we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The Board and management believes that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirements for the October submission. It was a tremendous effort across the Company involving all businesses and functions and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably improving the firm's overall liquidity and pre-positioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the Company, albeit at some cost. We took many other important actions which hopefully you've had the chance to review in our public filings. Moving back to the quarter and moving on to page 2 revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year on year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Non-interest revenue was up $1.3 billion driven by strong performance in the CIB. Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million both year on year and quarter on quarter, largely driven by two notable expense items in Consumer which I'll talk about later as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge which took effect this quarter and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes Consumer reserve builds of $225 million primarily Card. But against that we have a net reserve release in wholesale for Oil & Gas of about $50 million. So as I said net income was $6.3 billion. And while down 8% year on year you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year's results, most notably significant tax benefits. If you adjust for tax, legal expense and credit reserves net income is up over $800 million year on year. Dealing with Oil & Gas here, we are encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continued to improve. Capital markets opened more broadly to these clients and we experienced lower draws against our facilities than previously anticipated. So a combination of paydowns, opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy. Moving to page 3 and capital, key takeaways from this page, capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter on quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9% as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth as well as liability actions taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter on quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that as excess liquidity at the Bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Moving on to page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continue to experience record deposit growth, more than twice the industry average, up 11% year on year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. Based on the FDIC survey for 2016 we were number one in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it's primarily driven by Mortgage we also saw 14% growth in Auto, 9% in Business Banking and 7% in Card loans. Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than three-quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double digits this quarter and we expect share gains to accelerate. So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year on year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high quality loans to our portfolio. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 1% as the strong momentum in Card and Auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher Card origination costs and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenue it's a high-class problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter we would expect revenues for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter on quarter on higher acquisition costs. But it will clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. Expense of $6.5 billion is up year on year, as I said, driven by two notable items totaling $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed from a merchant in bankruptcy and the second is a modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth which is in line with Investor Day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency. Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In Card we built $200 million of reserve this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio including newer vintages which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. In Auto we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high-quality loan growth. Now turning to page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Total revenues for CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year on year, was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IBCs on record for a third quarter, too, up 15%. With strong market performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year on year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for Oil & Gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter. Diving deeper, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year on year with strong performance across products. We ranked number one in global IDCs, maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked number one in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year on year. And we continue to rank number two globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year. In equity underwriting fees were up 38% year on year. With a stable market backdrop and strong investor demand issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked number one in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA. And we also ranked number one on a number of deals basis for overall ECM and IPOs. Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were up 12% from a high water mark last year and we ranked number one. In terms of outlook given the strength this quarter we expect IDCs to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year on year. Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year on year, clients were active and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post-Brexit with good client flow as well as anticipation of and uncertainty around central bank actions. Currencies in emerging markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but was slowed down slightly. Credit and securitized products came back from a weak prior period with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market making and new issuance environment, resulting in a particularly strong quarter. Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last year's strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volumes. Taking treasury services and security services revenues together, each were over $900 million with strong forward pipelines and levers to higher rates. Moving on to page 6 and Commercial Banking. Commercial Banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year on year driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads as well as higher IB revenues. Loan growth continued to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year on year despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we've been making this year are delivering results. We've added over 100 net new bankers, opened seven new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage and we've added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year. CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. We are also seeing favorable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions, but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments and as I said these investments are already paying off. Finally, credit performance remained strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by Oil & Gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for Oil & Gas here as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter. Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset Management on page 7. Asset Management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year on year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense of $2.1 billion was up slightly year on year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi-asset, including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter, as well as inflows in alternatives and fixed income partially offset by outflows in equity products. In addition, we were the beneficiaries of $22 billion of liquidity flows this quarter, capturing more than our share of money in motion given money market reform. AUM grew 4% and overall client assets 5% to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion respectively, driven by market as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remained solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we have record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year on year driven by mortgage. Skipping over page 8 and Corporate where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant items to highlight. So turning to page 9 and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter on quarter on continued strength in loan growth even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution-based liquidity actions, which will be fully in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect non-interest revenue to be down quarter on quarter based upon our current outlook for IDCs and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues also including higher Card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NIR to come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year on year, bringing full-year expense in at approximately $56 billion, consistent with our guidance and self-funding the Consumer items I mentioned. So to wrap up, strong performance whichever way you look at it this quarter. We are continuing to demonstrate that our operating model and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while at the Company we are proud of this quarter's performance and, in particular, proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses, so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance. With that, operator, please open up the line and we can take questions. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Mike.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think there's three or four things to mention. The first is that I would say that the industry generally had a pretty weak third quarter last year. And so when you think about the year-over-year comparison we are a little flattered by last year's performance. Not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless we are. Then we talked about the fact that this quarter the conditions were relatively favorable broadly and compare and contrast that to last year where there were pockets of activity and client flow but there were also pockets where people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. So I think client flow quite broadly across the environment would characterize the quarter. In terms of the competitive performance I would say it feels like we did well. Obviously, we're the first to report, apart from Citi this morning. It feels like we did relatively well, so we may have gained some share. Certainly, hopefully the momentum in terms of the business we've been building and the way we are serving our clients will service in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time. But, obviously, there can be a bit of volatility in the market share space. So we prefer to look at it more through time and we feel pretty good about the performance.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say we don't specifically target a competitive set. But I will tell you that our balance sheet, we talked about it many times on this call before that we do have the capacity to put our balance sheet and our resources to work for our clients, for our best clients. And we think about using those resources in the context of overall relationships. So if any period is more leverage constrained and has less access we may have competitive advantage. And certainly we will continue to make those resources available to our clients.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I don't know, Glenn, if you recall that we had a bit of discussion about this last quarter and guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, partly because, obviously, at 250-ish basis points I think we could call that pretty low historically. But also because over the course of the last couple of years we have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near prime space, still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So we are getting paid for that. So we are doing it within our risk appetite, doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate. So what we are seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-offs, gradual increases completely in line with how we underwrote those loans and our expectations. And so as you look forward for us over the course of the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena to generally continue, again, slowly. We are growing our portfolio, we are going to see the seasoning of those vintages as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned cause us to build a reserve but for the right reasons.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, nothing significant, Glenn. No significant changes to our sensitivity.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say that all of the things that you mentioned, whether it's closed loop network, whether it's our new proprietary products, whether it's our investments in the technology platform and the business in merchant services are all at good returns that ultimately will drive the business to be profitable in the future as it has been in the past. So we haven't given specific guidance for ROE targets for this business but nothing has changed over the medium term for what we think that the performance of the business would be.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's a very competitive business and it's very profitable. So all other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we haven't given specific cost guidance going out beyond this year at this point. But our objective will remain consistent with those that we stated previously which is we continue to try and become more efficient across our businesses. As you know, we are at the tail end but not finished on a couple of large expense programs in our largest businesses so that we create capacity to be able to invest in the businesses broadly, whether that's in products, in marketing, in investment, in innovation, all of which we're doing as much as we can as long as we do it well. So it's going to come down to if we think we have investment opportunities that we can execute well that have an appropriate return we would like to keep doing that and in order to have the right to do it we would like to become more and more efficient in our core business operation. So we haven't actually given guidance. I think I would characterize it as expenses under control creating capacity to invest. But we will decision investments based upon their merits and, obviously, explain them to you in the future at Investor Day, if not another venue.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, first of all, I would say that based upon the speech and, obviously, you know that there are still some unanswered questions with respect to specific parts of the proposal which I will come back to, but based upon the speech moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy. And using the capital stack add-up using, our G-SIB score and our stress drawdown actually you would come out with a capital constraint under CCAR that's pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. So in that sense because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year's test by both of those two measures, which is a space we've played in for a while. We've been, as we talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints, somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. I think the things we don't know are, obviously, how funding or liquidity shock will be incorporated. And in any case this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle, so it's a whole cycle away from now. So we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct as we have previously. And so I don't think it's a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above the top end of our range. Meanwhile, we are at the top end of our range now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I would just generally speaking with respect to our rate sensitivity, as I think you know we are most sensitive to the front end of the curve but to IOER and prime. So we do have LIBOR-based assets but also liabilities. A good example would be commercial loans on the asset side or long-term debt on the liability side. But our notional mismatch is not particularly big. And so as a consequence, the impact of LIBOR curve moves has been not very significant on our P&L, we wouldn't expect it to be. I will say that the LIBOR moves were one of the features that our rates business had a perspective around. And they got good client flow in and around that trade. And so it was one of the catalysts, one of many, but one of the catalysts that we point to in terms of the ability for rates to monetize flow as we had a lot of client flow around that conviction. But I wouldn't be able to put a number on it for you.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think we, obviously, did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform into our government fund. But we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to attract operating deposits. And so as I look at our overall strong deposit growth I wouldn't say it was equally but it was pretty much equally wholesale operating and retail deposit growth. So we feel good about both of those.
MARIANNE LAKE: I might just give for context remind you all, or maybe you recall, that for a number of years now, for a fairly long time we've been standing up at Investor Day and other venues saying that customer experience is the central tenet for how we think about engaging with all of our clients but certainly our retail clients in the branches. And we have been very, very focused on investing in customer experience broadly defined and have made great progress, I think, in doing that. And also we had talked about the fact that what we are looking for very, very clearly is deep customer relationships, engaged customers. We want to be primary bank. We want to gather deeper share of wallet. So balance is not necessarily products. And so, again, remember saying that cross-sell is an outcome, it's not an objective. And that certainly is a philosophy with which we have designed our compensation and performance structures for the branches. We review them regularly, at least annually to make sure that they continue to be aligned with our objectives and, again, objectives about the engaged relationship with customers, good customer experience in the right products, all the right reasons the right way. So as we think about those objectives and how we've designed our plan and as we look inwardly not just, obviously, because of the news now but also regularly in our BAU capacity we feel like our plans are designed to incent those behaviors.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say, first of all, I would say we, I will tell you, we are on track with respect to the commitments Daniel made to you to deliver over time the $2.8 billion of expense saves. While we are not finished yet we are substantially through that program. So it's moved from being a plan through execution to being in the later stages of execution. So we feel very good about that, which means that all other things equal that $19 billion is still a reasonable level of expense target. However, obviously we pay for performance. And so clearly if we have significant out-performance next year relative to our expectations at the time of setting those plans, there would be some variable cost associated with it. But for every dollar of out-performance the variable cost may not always be the same. So, obviously, it also depends upon the mix and payout ratios and all those sorts of things. But a large, large portion of it would be, it would be, obviously, as you know incredibly accretive because we would be leveraging all of our scale, so the only variable cost would really be comp, largely.
MARIANNE LAKE: So first of all based upon last year's results for us we are at the floor for the stress capital buffer. Not to suggest, by the way, that we wouldn't continue to want to properly understand and better understand how we can through time make sure that we are performing the best we can under stress within our risk appetite. But we are at that floor right now. So within those constraints what we are trying to do is be within our risk appetite, manage risk properly but also add shareholder value. We have to carry that capital anyway, so we would want to use it well.
MARIANNE LAKE: So for your purposes I'm going to talk about NII. We don't really manage to NIM. But you can, obviously, back into it. So if we ended up in a situation right now where rates were flat throughout all of 2017 which for what it's worth I don't think is pretty much anyone's central expectation right now, but if we were rate flat you've seen us grow our core loans and our loan balances pretty strongly, pretty consistently across businesses. And while we may not be able to replicate our 15% core loan growth forever, certainly we can continue to grow our loans. So on that plus mix shift away from securities over time we should be able to deliver $1.5 billion of incremental NII next year rate flat. You know that if rates are -- if we are fortunate enough for the right reasons that we see a hike this year, at the end of this year and get the full benefit of that next year, it will be higher than that. And you've seen our earnings and risk disclosures, they've been pretty close to a $3 billion number on a 100 basis point move for a while, most of which is front end.
MARIANNE LAKE: So look, we are aware, obviously, of the riskier types of CRE lending, the types of lending that attract scrutiny for reasonable reasons considering how they've performed in past cycles. We are also mindful of where we are in the cycle and take that into consideration in our underwriting. So we have and continue to avoid what I would characterize as the riskier segments and those segments that performed poorly in previous cycles. And we really stick to our knitting, if that's an American expression, in terms of continuing to do what we are good at within our risk appetite. And so if you think about our commercial real estate growth, Commercial Term Lending is about three-quarters of our portfolio. And you know that we are very focused on smaller loan size, term B -- sorry, class B, class C properties with low vacancy rates. So rent stabilized, supply constrained markets, underwrite to low LTVs, good debt service coverage. We look at forward rates and current rents. And so we really have an expertise in a specific niche and we compete on speed and certainty of execution, not on credit and structure. So we feel pretty good about our exposures and even in our more traditional real estate banking space we have avoided the riskier segments with limited construction lending exposure, homebuilders minimal exposure. We are pretty disciplined about it.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we are a primarily prime lender in Auto. We are the number one prime lender. We actually have the lowest share in subprime among the national banks. So it is less than 5% of our origination. So I wouldn't speak specifically to underwriting in the lower FICO sectors, not where we play at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: So not that I would comment on except for we have recently decided to pull back on 84-month plus term loans on all FICO bands, just as where we are in the cycle as we see the risks of that type of lending. So we continue to calibrate our underwriting. But I wouldn't comment on seeing anything specifically.
MARIANNE LAKE: Auto?
MARIANNE LAKE: We've built $25 million of reserves this quarter for Auto and we expect to continue. We think the Auto opportunity is still strong and we have a great franchise. We have great manufacturing partnerships that are growing strongly, too. So as we grow that portfolio I would expect us to continue to grow reserves modestly in 2017. However, we are expecting charge-offs to stay under control.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so you are right. And, obviously, even specifically for JPMorgan if you look at our stress results that [handicapped] by the Fed over the course of the last three years has been reasonable volatility. And clearly it's not the case that we will expect it to be completely stable. I would not expect to see the same levels of volatility going forward as we've seen historically as the test has, as you know, over time occasionally included new not insignificant features. And while that may continue to be the case I would think that there would be a bit more stability. But we haven't actually gone through and finalized our thinking about what the buffers would look like.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, before I talk about the prioritization of capital distributions I would just start by saying our capital management policies prior to this year's CCAR and this year's resolution had us making those actions regardless of whether they were allowed to be reflected in a test. And, obviously, as part of the resolution planning we have revised our policies to include more granular triggers. So our policies do with some specificity run pretty granularly through time through a stress speak to the sorts of actions that we would be leaning into and taking, even if they don't get reflected in the test. With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividends has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately still a part of the baseline minimum standard, so there will be possibly some natural constraint there. It hasn't changed, at this point anyway, the Board's determination or management's determination about the order of priority. We would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividend. And I think even though there may be some natural constraints I think it would be above 30.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we are very focused across the spectrum of our businesses on developing better digital capabilities to allow seamless engagement with customers and acquisition through digital channels. There are complexities associated with documentation and standards for know your customer and anti-money laundering that we're continuing to work through. But ultimately it should be achievable, and we are working on it. So one of the things that we have previously mentioned is that the majority of our Consumer accounts are opened in branches. One of the reasons among others why branches are [still] important to us as well as advice centers. And we will continue to work on trying to see how far and how fast we can move people to be able to have a better digital experience opening accounts with us.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, I will just start by pointing out that all of the businesses, all of our businesses, not just the ones that I talked about at the high level, not just macro spreads equities, but even if you go a level below that quite granular, all of our businesses did really quite well this quarter. So not to overuse the phrase firing on all cylinders but it really was pretty consistent. And normally you might see pockets of more strength and less strength. So I think it would be hard to imagine replicating this kind of strength through time consistently. But the fourth quarter is seasonally low and we have no reason to expect that it would not be.
MARIANNE LAKE: So there isn't a whole lot of really clear new news. So as we think about all of the -- FRTB we've talked about before, modest and manageable, nothing about that has changed for us. But, obviously, there's the advanced and standardized credit operational proposals out there. The most important thing that we've yet to really, and there are pluses and minuses in it and different for us than others maybe. But the one thing that we haven't really heard about yet, Betsy, is how it will all be calibrated and calibration will be very important. So we are expecting to hear over the course of the next short while, and maybe that will be delayed some just given some of the discussion. And we will update you when we hear a bit more about how it's all going to come together. But right now it's still a little unclear.
MARIANNE LAKE: Many thanks everybody.",0.19000000000000014,0.3910000000000025,1,0.14498313643676217,0.16000417164195338
22,Q3_2015,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $6.8 billion, EPS of $1.68 and a return on tangible common equity of 15% on $23.5 billion of revenue. If you exclude tax adjustments, legal expense and net reserve releases, our adjusted performance was $1.32 a share with a 12% return on tangible common equity. And we've only adjusted for these three items because other small items that might be considered non-core netted to zero. Underlying results were somewhat mixed on the back of market conditions. The Consumer business had strong performance with loan growth across products driving overall firm-wide core loan growth of 15%. In the Corporate and Investment Bank, we saw outperformance in investment banking revenue and solid trading performance. Commercial banking revenue was down driven by lower IB revenues in a declining market. And Asset Management revenues reflected lower market levels, driving weaker client sentiment and transactional revenues. There were two significant items this quarter. First, tax benefits of $2.2 billion, the size of which speaks of the complexity of tax matters during the financial crisis. We took appropriately prudent position in our tax reserves and now we've reached resolution on those matters. The majority of this is in Corporate with a portion in the CIB. The second item is firm-wide legal expense of $1 billion after tax relating to a range of matters but including the recently announced CDS settlement. Also reflected in our results is a net reserve release of $281 million pretax. Which reflects a little less than $600 million of consumer reserve releases as favorable credit trends continue, offset by a build of a little over $300 million in Wholesale, approximately $160 million of which is additional reserves associated with the oil and gas sector given expectations that energy prices will remain lower for longer. Skipping over page 2 and turning onto page 3 and our balance sheet. We continue to make progress against our capital targets and as expected, advanced and standardized fully phased in CET1 ratios are in line with each other at 11.4% this quarter. Also, we continue to expect the standardized ratio will be our floor from here and the improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation. We also built Tier 1 and total capital, adding $1.2 billion of preferred stock and $1.5 billion of subordinated debt this quarter. We returned $2.7 billion of net capital to shareholders including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share. Firm and Bank SLR were at 6.3% and 6.5% respectively with the increase driven almost equally by capital generation and a reduction in average assets. While we're on the balance sheet, you can see on the call out from the page that on a spot basis our balance sheet is down $160 billion year-to-date and an incremental $32 billion this quarter as we reduced nonoperating deposits by over $150 billion exceeding our commitment. Total deposits are only down $90 billion, reflecting growth in more stable balances, particularly Consumer. Finally, with respect to GSIB, we estimate that today we are squarely in the 4% bucket given actions taken and final US rules as compared to 4.5% at the beginning of the year. Now let's turn to page 4 and Consumer and Community Banking. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $10.9 billion was down 4% year on year, driven by mortgage on lower net servicing revenue. We remain on track to deliver expense reductions versus our $2 billion commitment and year-to-date expenses were down around $600 million reported and over $700 million adjusted for legal expense. Our headcount is down 10,000 year-to-date and more than 40,000 since 2012. Underlying business drivers are strong and based on the 2015 FDIC deposit survey which just came out, we grew our deposits nearly 2 times the industry growth rate. Average loans are up 8% with core loans up 23%. Our customer base continues to expand. We added 900,000 households year-over-year and our active mobile base is up 21%. Moving to page 5, Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated strong results with net income of $954 million and an ROE of 32%. NII was down 1% quarter on quarter and 7% year on year driven by spread compression offset by continued growth in deposits. And non-interest revenue is growing solidly, up 5% quarter on quarter seasonally and 5% year on year on continued strong debit and investment revenue. Overall expenses were down 3% year on year on lower headcount from branch efficiency. We continue to see robust performance across key drivers. Average deposits were up 9% and we grew deposits in all of our top 50 MSAs and gained share in nine of our top 10. Client assets were up 3% but down 4% quarter on quarter, broadly in line with the market and net new money was positive $3 billion for the quarter. Business Banking loan growth remained strong with average loan balances up 6% year on year and originations up 4% from a strong 2014. Next Mortgage Banking on page 6. Overall net income was $602 million for the quarter. Originations of $30 billion were up 41% from the prior year and up slightly quarter on quarter as we benefited from a strong pipeline and continued improvement in the purchase market. We continue to add high quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter. Total revenue decreased sequentially, primarily driven by lower net servicing revenue on lower MSR risk management. We expect non-interest revenue to be down around $250 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Expenses of $1.1 billion were down 13% year on year despite higher volumes as we continued to manage down our costs. On credit we released $575 million of reserves, including $200 million in the noncredit impaired portfolio and $375 million in the purchased credit impaired portfolio reflecting an improvement in both actual and expected delinquencies and a sustained improvement in home prices. Finally, our net charge-offs were $41 million and approximately $60 million normalized and this is a reasonable estimate for the near term. Moving on to page 7, Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto. Overall net income of $1.1 billion with an ROE of 22% and revenue of $4.8 billion, was up 2% year on year on higher operating lease income in Auto as well Card revenue up slightly reflecting higher NII on volume, spread and lower interest reversals, offset by the impact of changes to some of our co-brand partnerships. On our partners we were thrilled to announce the renewal of two of our key partners, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. We look forward to continued investment and growth in these important relationships. And while we repriced to the current competitive market, our ROE target for the Card business in total remains unchanged. However, expect the revenue rate for the fourth quarter to be 11.75% plus or minus. Expense was $2.2 billion, up 8% year on year, driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing spend. On drivers, we continued to see strong year-over-year growth in volumes and transactions across our businesses. In Card, core loan growth was 3%, sales growth was 6%. Commerce solutions volumes were up 11% driven by continued strong spend from existing clients but also from the addition of new merchants. Lastly, in Auto, results continued to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 9% and the pipeline is good. Finally, on Credit, the net charge-off rate for the quarter was 241 basis points and we expect net charge-offs of around 250 basis points over the medium term. Turning to page 8 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.2 billion and an ROE of 13% adjusted for legal taxes and reserves. In Banking, it was a strong quarter with IB revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% year on year. We continue to rank number one in global IBCs and ranked number one in North America and EMEA. It was another outstanding quarter for Advisory, up 22%. We grew wallet share by 150 basis points year-over-year, maintaining our number two ranking. Equity underwriting fees were down 35%, generally in line with the market but from a particularly strong prior year. This quarter we ranked number one both in North America and EMEA. Set Underwriting was up 17%, driven by higher non-investment grade fees, we maintained our number one ranking, gaining 30 basis points of share. However, expect DTMCs to be down year-over-year given the current pipeline. Treasury services revenue were flat quarter on quarter but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spreads with underlying transaction volumes remaining stable. Moving on to Markets. Revenue of $4.3 billion was down 6% adjusted for business simplification. With mixed results in Fixed Income but another strong performance in Equities. Fixed income revenue was $2.9 billion, down 11% adjusted. In macro products we saw strong performance in currencies and emerging markets driven by higher activity on the back of market volatility in Asia and Brazil. Rates was down slightly given a particularly strong September of last year. And Commodities was down on low levels of client activity, again, compared to a strong prior year. It was a slow quarter in Credit with lower volumes as clients were on the sidelines given the challenging market conditions. Equity markets had another strong quarter with revenues of $1.4 billion, up 9% year on year, driven by reasonably broad strength across products and regions with good performance in cash, but particular strength in Asia and derivatives. Security Services revenue was $915 million, versus guidance of $950 million. Given depressed market levels which impacted both revenues and as assets under custody with Emerging Markets, which is one of our more profitable segments, being hit particularly hard. If markets remain at these levels, fourth quarter revenues will also be lower than previous guidance. On Credit we saw a reserve build of $232 million, including $128 million for Oil & Gas. Finally onto Expenses. Total expense was up 2% year on year at $6.1 billion. Compensation expense was down 13% with a comp-to-revenue ratio of 30% in the quarter. And non-compensation expense was up 14% driven by higher legal expense, partially offset as we realized the expense benefits of business simplification. Moving on to Commercial Banking and page 9. Commercial Banking generated net income of $518 million on revenue of $1.6 billion and an ROE of 14%. Revenue was down 5% quarter on quarter driven by lower investment banking revenue as we saw fewer large transactions in the quarter. However, the pipeline for the fourth quarter is solid and we still expect record growth IB revenues this year, exceeding $2 billion. Expenses of $719 million were in line with guidance. Loan balances were a record at $162 billion, up 13% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter. Driven by continued outperformance in Commercial Real Estate where quarter on quarter growth of 4% exceeded the industry across both multi-family and real estate banking. C&I loans were flat, in line with the industry. Mature markets were relatively flat but we saw growth in our expansion markets, up 4% quarter on quarter. Credit performance with the portfolio remains strong with no net charge-offs and an $84 million increase in reserves included a modest build for Oil & Gas. Overall, while results were mixed this quarter, the underlying fundamentals of the Commercial Bank remain strong. Pipelines are trending higher in C&I and remain robust in commercial real estate. Our expansion market loan balances are up 20% year on year. Calling activity is up substantially across line segments and we've added around 400 new middle market relationships this year. Moving on to page 10 and Asset Management. Net income of $475 million with a 28% pretax margin and 20% ROE. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 5% year on year, driven by lower markets which also drove lower transactional revenue as well as the sale of retirement planning services in 2014 which drove $70 million of the year-over-year decline. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect revenues to show normal seasonality from this low base assuming current market levels. Expenses were relatively flat. And AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion held up well and were relatively flat year on year with negative markets and outflows driving a 4% sequential decline. We were not immune to the impact of interest rate uncertainty and equity markets and while we did experience overall modest net outflows, we had positive flows in our less market sensitive multi-asset class and alternative platforms. In Banking we had record loan balances of $109 billion, up 7% year on year, driven by Mortgage which was up 19%. And lastly, we continue to report strong investment performance with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Turning to page 11 and Corporate. Treasury and CIO results for the quarter were very close to home. The Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion, driven by tax benefits. And finally, firm-wide NIM was up 7 basis points quarter on quarter given the mix shift away from cash and securities, towards higher loan balances and on an overall smaller balance sheet. Loans are the primary driver of nearly $250 million improvement in NII and given market implied NIM and NII should be relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Finally, our loan-to-deposit ratio improved 8 percentage points year-to-date to 64%. Turning to page 12 and moving on to the fourth quarter outlook. Just a few items to call out. First, you'll see we updated our adjusted expense target to $56.5 billion, plus or minus for the full year, which is better than our previous guidance and would equate to the fourth quarter adjusted expense being relatively flat to the third. We're expecting core loan growth of 15% plus or minus to continue in the fourth quarter. And finally, on Markets revenue. Starting with business simplification, which will drive a 2% decline year on year. In addition, we expect to see normal seasonal declines in the fourth quarter versus the third. And looking back over the last three years, that decline has been on average around 15%. And so far in October across asset classes, the markets are pretty quiet. Obviously we're only two weeks into the quarter and it's too early to give specific guidance, but based on those facts alone analyst estimates appear high. Wrapping up, overall the Company performed quite well against a backdrop of interest rate uncertainty and volatile markets. We continue to invest in our businesses and our underlying drivers are growing strongly and we're gaining share and we have more than successfully delivered against each of our capital, balance sheet and expense targets. Just before I finish, on one of those investments we're making, I want to update you on the progress we're making on our payment strategy. We continue to capitalize on our leadership position in payments, we have unparalleled assets in our issuing scale, we have the largest wholly owned merchant acquirer, our own close leaf network in ChaseNet and now a digital wallet in Chase Pay, which will be launched more broadly this year. The beauty of this is that we're able to bundle all of these capabilities together to provide better pricing experiences for merchants, including access to data, as well as a better and more relevant experience for customers. We expect to process more than $50 billion of Chase card volumes over ChaseNet in 2016 and Gordon will share more details at Money 2020. With that, operator, please open up the line to Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: There are a couple of different questions in there and maybe I'll try and separate them. My comments about the seasonality in the fourth quarter were most particularly towards Markets revenues and less so towards the IB revenue space. With IB revenues, it's a mixed story. Talking now about the sort of Banking revenues rather than Markets revenues. So the pipeline for M&A remains very constructive and really pretty good, so we're expecting to continue to have strength in M&A in the fourth quarter. With ECM you saw obviously a pretty sharp falloff in activity in the third quarter. We have seen the pipeline in ECM to the degree that that shows you visibility into the fourth quarter which is somewhat limited. We have seen that build up and so there is possibility that we'll be able to pull through some of that into the fourth quarter. But that will depend upon how the markets behave. With respect to DCM, our sort of guidance there was a commentary really mainly to the strength of the fourth quarter last year and on relative basis, the pipeline is down. And it's really to do with normal refinances are slowing and the maturity wall is smaller but it's still healthy. It's just not going to be at the same levels that we saw last year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Look, the situation for us in markets was one where there was volatility, regardless of you how you want to characterize it, and people were acting -- our clients were acting on the back of that. We were able to capitalize on that flow. We were able to intermediate for our clients, put our capital [at risk and make] some money. We did pretty well where there was volatility. Where there wasn't, it was more about, to your point, more about low levels of activity, people on the sidelines. It was tougher to make money because less was happening rather than anything else more significant than that. So far in the fourth quarter we're two weeks in, it's too early to say, but there's not been a tremendous change in the landscape.
MARIANNE LAKE: Looking at the revenue rate, the guidance, remember our guidance previously had been you should expect our revenue rate to be at the low end of the 12% to 12.5% range. The most important thing we want you to take away from talking about our co-brand partners is that we feel great about having signed up United Airlines and Southwest Airlines and partnering with them again for the medium term. And the economics of those deals on a standalone basis are still really very good. But the co-brand space is very competitive and when any of those contracts are going to be renegotiated at this point, they're going to be renegotiated to competitive levels. And so, it's really the fact that we're seeing that is going to come through in our revenue rate in the fourth quarter which is going to push it down to below 12%. It doesn't change the fact that the ROE target for the business is still 20% and that the economics of those partnerships are still good. Remember,
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say, first of all, we gave some expense goals in Investor Day for both Consumer Businesses as well as for the CIB. And those were I think pretty sizable goals, $2 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the Consumer Businesses and $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the CIB. And we are working through that. We are on track in both of them. I think I said earlier that adjusted, the Consumer Businesses in the three quarters so far are $700 million down year-over-year in expenses. So against the $2 billion target, we're certainly getting there. And on the CIB, we expected 2015 to be mainly about forcing out those business simplification expenses and we've essentially done that too. So we're on track. We're pushing hard. We still have work to do. We are always going to be diligent on our expenses and generally speaking at Investor Day we also said we're going to be on or down which is actually pushing hard to keep them down but not at the expense of good investments in the business. So obviously we are going to respond appropriately to the revenue pressure but not overreact.
JAMIE DIMON: I've spoken my whole life about good expenses and bad expenses. Bad expenses are waste, things you don't need. You don't have [to trade through] processing, things like that. We want certain expenses to go up. When we find marketing opportunities in Card, we're going to spend it. If the Investment Bank does better, the comp accrual is going to go up. That's how we run the Company. That's not ever going to change.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Mike, thanks for that. So $700 million, if you adjust for legal expense in the Consumer Businesses year-to-date, we'll do some more in the fourth quarter. And year-to-date on business simplification, which I think for in total was about $1.5 billion, we've done $1.3 billion. In total, that's $2 billion so far. Obviously more work to do in 2016. With respect to the adjusted overhead ratio, it speaks a bit more to seasonality of revenues than anything else.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'll start. Jamie, you can yes or no at the end. Mike, we would say that the US economy is doing pretty well there. We're seeing good demand for loans in the Consumer space and reasonably good sentiment in the Business Banking space and our core loan growth numbers do show that. There's nothing particularly funky in the loan growth numbers. We do our very best to show them in the right light. I would take a slightly different perspective on the jobs report on the non-farm payrolls. And not to sort of over think it, but while I know it was somewhat lower than people were expecting or possibly hoping for, it's still at around 140,000, almost two times what would be required to have stable unemployment. So it's only one report too. You can't overreact to it. It's not that we're seeing anything that's causing us any concern and our outlook for the fourth quarter is pretty solid I think. Jamie, anything?
JAMIE DIMON: Nothing to add.
MARIANNE LAKE: We did better than we had targeted on our non-op deposits. We worked very, very hard but we told you we would on derivative notionals, compressionals, so our level 3 assets. It is absolutely the case, not to diminish the amount of work we've done and the progress we've made, that we obviously went after the most impactful -- least impactful to the client franchise, most impactful to the ratio with a less revenue [give-up] first. We made great progress. It becomes increasingly, not exponentially, but increasingly more difficult for every net basis point. That's not to say, by the way, that we aren't continuing to work very hard at it and optimize and that we won't push further. But we're not at a place right now where we're going to target anything structurally below this, except for over the longer term just continuing to work through it. And our overall capital target, we're at 11.4% now. Our overall capital target still in the short to medium term is still 12%.
JAMIE DIMON: I just want to add, in the new world we have to obviously monitor and push down to all the business levels, GSIB, CCAR, Basel, LCR and SLR, and we want to optimize all of them. So we're only living with this for a couple years now. As we embed it in our systems, we'll have a better way to track it and monitor it. Over time, I would expect the GSIB will come down a little bit. It only comes down in lumps. You got to make a big difference to go from 4% to 3.5% but imagine over time, I'm talking about years. I'm not talking about anything you'd see this quarter. We are very comfortable where we are today. Over years, you might have to change some of your business strategies but I think it's a better thing not to be an outlier in GSIB.
JAMIE DIMON: It has nothing to do with next year, Betsy. When I say over time, it just happens that JPMorgan built a global corporate investment bank. 70% of it is financial institutions, 30% corporate. We easily could have been built the other way around, we focused on it over time. When I say over time, it might be quite easy for us to say that over five to six years let's focus more on corporates and less on financials and that will affect your GSIB fairly substantially. That's what I'm talking about. It has nothing to do with CCAR for next year or anything like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: A couple of really small points on CCAR for next year for what it's worth is we were constrained in CCAR by leverage. We have issued $6 billion of preferreds in the year. We are reacting to try and make sure that we are managing our binding constraints or our most binding constraints. So we're working on that. The other thing to note is that we're at 11.4% as we sit here now. So we're not gliding a long way from where we need to get to. Both of those things together, with obviously our profitability, should mean that we have incremental opportunity. But our range is 55% to 75% and we hope to be in that range.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just a couple of things. First of all, I think the [FSB] thing was a sort of leak. So it's as good as it is. I will tell you that the news on structured notes was not strongly positive but we hadn't banked on it being. So not entirely pleasing but not disappointing relative to our models and expectations. Other things to pay attention to anyway are there's no change to the internal TLAC assumptions. The clean holding Company rule is one that we're watching out for. But fundamentally -- and then there was the timing. Is there going to be a substantially elongated transition period? I would call it all fairly marginal. It hasn't changed the overall picture for us. We're at around 16% and we'll figure out the FSB proposal that's leaked out wasn't shockingly different and we'll see how the Fed responds.
MARIANNE LAKE: So with respect to the fourth quarter, we are expecting our loans to grow and overall net-net [rotation out], cash and securities to loans would be supportive of NII. But remember, the biggest boost to our NIM was associated -- or was a big boost to our NIM was associated with changing the mix, reducing our overall cash balances. So, a few things going on. The outlook for the fourth quarter being relatively flat was associated with market implied rates which are relatively flat. And so in the law of big numbers, that plus or minus a few basis points is what we're expecting. With respect to looking out to 2016, obviously we don't know what's going to happen with the rate curve. If rates stay very flat we should still have upward pressure on our NII associated with the change in mix of our balance sheet. So the fact that we've got a smaller interest earning asset base and more loans and less cash and less securities should be supportive even on flat rates. We don't know when rates will rise but if market [implies] are followed or if the Fed [dots] or anything like realistic, then that will be even more constructive. Remember in the first year, we get the biggest benefit from short end rates and the first 50 basis points of them.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, unfortunately not.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say that first of all, with respect to purchased credit impaired, with this release we did on the $375 million, that's our baseline expectation for that portfolio. Our baseline expectation is no material incremental reserves. Obviously if things improve and they're sustained, then there may be more reserve releases. But I wouldn't try and model those. With respect to the noncredit impaired portfolio we talked about, you've seen our charge-offs at normalized 14 basis points. Our portfolio quality is really getting quite high. We're cycling through most of the significant risks. Reserve releases will be more modest and a little bit more periodic and several hundred million dollars next year, maybe $300 million plus or minus but not significantly more than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Look, our efficiency target at 55% was over three years or so and we still will be driving to get to around that level. But it does, as you quite rightly mention, include not just rates rising but a fair degree of normalization in rates. We'll see what happens in 2016. Obviously it's possible but we're not going to call an outlook on rates next year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So we've taken some large reserves in the last few quarters and our overall reserve number obviously is consistent with our expectations based upon the outlook for oil prices. There was a redetermination cycle that we reserved for in the first quarter and so there will be another one in the fall. We've been as forward leaning on that as we can be. Obviously I'm not saying that there may not be any net incremental reserve build but we're not expecting them to be significant. A lot of companies have tried to adjust their expense bases and otherwise help their position. So if energy prices stay around these levels and recover slowly, we're expecting, net, not to have material incremental reserves in the next quarter. We may see some.
MARIANNE LAKE: Let me deal first of all with production quarter-over-quarter revenues. Margins are down. Margins are down for two principal reasons. Remember, quarter-over-quarter, at least on a closed loan volume, we were at a consistent level. Margins are down because we moved a mix shift towards correspondent from retail towards purchase from re-fi as well as capacity in the industry, more capacity in the industry and therefore less constraints. So the production quarter-over-quarter revenue is more of a margin number than anything. With respect to year-over-year, I do want to make this clear. With respect to the guidance year-over-year that we should expect non-interest revenue for the mortgage Company in totality to be down $250 million. That brings our total year-over-year NIR down around $1 billion, maybe a little more, which is what we guided to at Investor Day. And it's more off the back of lower repurchase reserve releases, lower gains on Ginnie Mae sales and [XI] gains, non fee-based revenues that are to do with our third party UPB as well as run off in the UPB. So it's consistent with our guidance. It wasn't fully reflected in everyone's models. I think there was a third part to your question but I have to say I've -- oh, expenses, yes. Thank you. On expenses -- we continue to work very hard on our expense equation, both in terms of managing down the -- particularly in the servicing space by the way, managing down the default inventory in a number of different ways but also investing in our operating model. So in technology, to improve the production operations cycle process, also in our site strategy. So no, we are not done. We continue to work very hard at it. We have made great progress but we continue to work hard at it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific. We would be willing to take and we do take a look at things when they come up and if we are able to price for the risk and it's in a client segment or an entry we like we might be interested. But there's no -- we have no special comments on it. What we're really interested in is growing our underlying core loans with our customers that we can continue to do business with.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not as defaults happen. It's to do -- depends on whether it's reserve based lending or whether it's not. But as companies are either downgraded or as they are experiencing financial -- change in financial condition or the borrowing base is redetermined, we will act accordingly. We try to be as forward-leaning on that as is possible. We don't have perfect insight until some of that information becomes clear. That's the process.
JAMIE DIMON: And the reserve base lending, you basically take essentially current prices, you discount at a discount rate, you assume expenses, you [active real engineer] your force and things like that, and you see if you can make rollover the loan at a sound -- I'm going to call it 65% LTV and we think it's pretty good. That's what we're here for is to lend to clients particularly in tough times. You can't be a bank that every time something goes wrong you run away from your client. We also do things like stress test down to $30 oil, maintain $30 for 18 months and say, how much more reserve do you have to put up? I think I said somewhere, you can correct this number, Marianne, we're not in the same room, that if that happened, we think we're going to have to put up another $500 million or $750 million in reserves. Which is just not something we worry a lot about.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good evening.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's obviously a really great question. Unfortunately we really don't guide to our forward-looking issuance. You're right, we are above 150 basis points right now and we're also working on our leverage balance sheet. So we're working the dials exactly what you would expect us to, but we're not going to make any comments about forward issuance.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yep, I got it.
MARIANNE LAKE: The pipeline for 2016 is building up, so we don't have perfect visibility yet. We think obviously the deals that were being done in 2015 were skewed toward larger deals and we think there may be more flow in 2016 but it looks pretty healthy to us so far, but it's building up.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think over the last several quarters, forgive me if I'm slightly wrong but I don't think I'm entirely wrong, our sort of C&I growth has been broadly in line with the industry. Remember that over the course of 2013 and 2014, we did a lot of work on simplifying our businesses and that had an impact on the pace of our loan growth. But our mature markets are performing well. We're seeing growth in our expansion markets. We're adding new clients. We're culling our prospects. So everything is set to continue to see growth more going forward than we have in the past.
MARIANNE LAKE: There was about -- in CIB, there was about $47 million of metals and mining, about net-net $20 million of BAU growth and then just a few other normal BAU puts and takes, downgrades, upgrades. Other than those three things there was no one specific call out.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks, Chris.
MARIANNE LAKE: Of the $19 billion that we put on our balance sheet, around $10 billion, just a little over $10 billion was jumbo. The rest was conventional conforming.
MARIANNE LAKE: We'll have to get you the split.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the jumbo's like a third ARM. Counting the conforming, I think it's all fixed. That's what I remember.
MARIANNE LAKE: We'll confirm for you.
MARIANNE LAKE: You are right that at these kind of 2.5%, 250 basis point levels in Card, it does speak to the quality of the loans we're originating and the engagement with the customers. Which is much more now about driving, yes, some NII but really, really good spend and therefore lower credit quality. It's an integrated equation. We're expecting, given our originations and the runoff portfolio, the work loans running off in the portfolio that we're building is really very, very clean. We're expecting that those charge-off rates to be low for the short to medium term, to read out for the next year for sure. And there will be a combination of things that would drive that. But largely it would be environmental. We don't expect at this point, we have made changes to our credit box but they aren't material changes and we'll continue to test our appetite to want to do that and that may have an impact. But we're originating the vast majority of our cards in the super prime sector.
MARIANNE LAKE: Similar, yes. Compared to the industry, our originations are skewed to the prime space.
MARIANNE LAKE: And our LTVs are lower and our durations are in line or lower.
MARIANNE LAKE: The biggest comment I would make is that there was a lot of volatility, particularly in China, in the second part of or the last part of the second quarter. We were -- we did pretty well. We helped our clients. We didn't have significant open risk positions. We weren't very directional. We were able to do well in that situation. Also in the reversal, also on currency moves. It really is a comment I made about we're here to serve our clients, they were transacting, we were able to do risk intermediation in today for them and so we made money on both ends.
MARIANNE LAKE: Let me just talk qualitatively for a second and we'll get you some numbers. But we're focused on mobile and digital primarily because it's going to be great for the customer experience, it's what our customers want. And also because it's a significant enabler for reducing cost to serve and improving efficiency. So we've been very focused on whether it's quick deposit, whether it's quick pay, whether it's our mobile wallet, whether it's our mobile app and we've been seeing great results. I'm off the top of my head not going to be able to tell you the penetration rates but we can get back to you.
MARIANNE LAKE: I can tell you that we are growing our deposits nearly twice the industry. That we know. I think that's a reasonable indication for a bunch of different reasons and that we have a very highly rated app. I think the most highly rated bank app but we'll check that too.
MARIANNE LAKE: On the Fed funds and reverse repos, we had moved toward higher yielding, for example, emerging markets assets there. So we got some high yield there. We saw some yield on our trading book moving out of emerging markets. Just a bit of puts and takes. On securities, was it significant? I'm sorry, I'll come back to you. Operator, any more?
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you everyone.",-0.05000000000000005,0.4640000000000001,1,0.09471052379500541,0.10578789225289997
23,Q3_2014,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator, good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1, the Firm delivered strong underlying performance this quarter with net income of $5.6 billion on strong revenue of over $25 billion, up 5% year on year, reflecting growth across most of our businesses; and EPS of $1.36 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% for the quarter. Included in our results is Firm wide legal expense of approximately $1 billion after-tax, which relates to a number of matters, in large part an estimated amount for FX, which was treated as non-deductible tax purposes. There were also a number of smaller items, most notably a benefit of approximately $400 million of tax discrete items in corporate, as well as consumer reserve releases of $200 million pretax. Excluding these and other non-core items net income was approximately $5.8 billion reflecting strong core performance. The quarter was characterized by continued strength in our leadership positions as well as market share gains across the consumer businesses, higher levels of market volatility and client volumes than anticipated in CIB and record performance and asset management. Core loan growth for the quarter was strong, up 7% year on year, while maintaining strong discipline across the board and with encouraging trends in consumer. We've also continued to make progress against our capital targets with a CET1 ratio of 10.1% and firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.5%, all while returning approximately $3 billion of capital to shareholders the quarter, with gross share repurchases of $1.5 billion. Turning to page 2 -- adjusted expense that -- excluding legal, was $14.7 billion in the third quarter, down approximately $30 million quarter on quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 59%. We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses. Although our third-quarter adjusted expense may appear elevated in comparison to our full-year target of $58 billion, it was substantially driven by higher market performance versus our earlier expectations. If the positive momentum continues in the fourth quarter it is likely that our total adjusted expense will be above $58 billion, but obviously on higher revenues. On credit, despite lower reserve releases, Firm wide credit costs remain very low, driven by reduced net charge-offs. We expect total net charge-offs for 2014 to be less than $5 billion, which is below our previous guidance. Also included on this page are the returns generated by each of our businesses this quarter. Of note the commercial bank and asset management achieved 18% and 25% ROEs respectively, in-line with their through the cycle targets. CCB was at 19% and, if you back out the impact of legal expense in CIB, its ROE would've been around 14%. Moving on to capital on page 3 -- the Firm reported a fully phased in advanced CET1 ratio of 10.1%, up from 9.8% last quarter, reaching our year-end target of 10% plus. Not on the page but for your information the fully phased in standardized ratio was 10.5%. As you know, the final US rules on SLR and LCR were published in September. On SLR there were no notable changes and, as I just mentioned, the Firm's SLR was 5.5%, reaching our target level and we were at 5.7% for the bank this quarter. The LCR final US rule had some changes versus the NPR. Remember, we have been disclosing our LCR compliance relative to the Basel rules. The US final rule is in some ways more punitive, but we remain compliant with a more modest buffer. Moving on to business performance starting with CCB on page 4 -- the combined consumer businesses generated $2.5 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. I'd like to draw your attention to the right-hand side of the page; it shows that the long-term investments we've been making in the business are paying off, illustrated by the many leadership positions we hold. We are particularly proud of our customer satisfaction rankings. We're seeing continued strong growth in the underlying business drivers. Average deposits were up $35 billion year on year, an increase of 8%. Our active mobile customer base is up 22% and credit card sales volume of $120 billion was up 12% on strong new account originations. Across CCB we reduced headcount by over 10,000 this year against our year-end target of 8,000 outlined at Investor Day. And we expect a total reduction of 11,000 or so by year end. Finally, before I move on, as you are aware, JPMorgan and certain others in the financial services industry experienced cyber attacks this quarter. We are taking every step to protect our customers and our Firm, but these attacks highlight the need for continued and increased cooperation among businesses and the government to systemically reduce and resolve cyber threats. We are committed to doing our part. To date we have not observed elevated levels of fraud related to this matter. Turning to page 5, Consumer & Business Banking -- CBB generated net income of $914 million, up 20% year on year. The business continues to improve its operating leverage with an ROE of 33%, up 6 percentage points versus a year ago, with revenue up 5% and expense relatively flat. Underlying business drivers remain strong. Average deposits of $476 billion were up 9% year on year and client investment assets were up 16% to a record $208 billion. We continue to see strong deposit growth across regions and markets. In fact, for the third consecutive year we led the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth among the largest 50 US Banks. Overall we grow our deposit share in 46 of our 50 largest markets nationwide and we remain number one in three of the largest deposit markets. Moving on to revenue, net interest income was up 4% year on year driven by strong deposit growth offset by continued pressure on margins. And noninterest revenue was up 6% with investment revenue growth driven by Chase Private Client and with the addition of over 700,000 households driving stronger fee income. Expense is relatively flat with efficiency improvement in the business being offset by increased cost of control. Finally, on business banking originations, the momentum that we've seen in recent quarters continues and we believe we have outperformed the industry with loan originations for the quarter of $1.6 billion, up 27% year on year, down quarter on quarter seasonally. This reflects a combination of industry trends improving driven by business optimism generally continuing to remain strong and improving banking performance, especially in the expansion market as our targeted strategies mature. We do expect the strong growth to continue through the remainder of the year. Mortgage Banking on page 6. Overall mortgage banking net income was $439 million for the quarter with an ROE of 10%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging, mortgage production pretax income, ex-repurchase, was slightly positive for the quarter, a little better than guidance on better-than-expected expense performance. Originations are approximately $21 billion or up 26% quarter on quarter against a market that we estimate to be up approximately 10%. Therefore we believe we've gained share and that share gain has been in high-quality jumbo and conventional eligible bonds which, as you know, are the segments we are focusing on. As a reminder, with purchase mix up the business has become much more seasonal with volume and profitability peaks in the second and third quarters and lows in the first and fourth. Given this we still expect the fourth-quarter results to be a small negative as previously guided. Finally, on production we had a $62 million benefit in the quarter driven by refinements to our repurchase reserve. On to servicing, net servicing-related revenue of $639 million was down $54 million quarter on quarter, again on the better side of our guidance due to gains on the sale of Ginnie Mae loans. Looking forward into the fourth quarter, core servicing revenue will continue to decline and we expect less benefits from other revenue sources, such as those from Ginnie Mae sales, given lower delinquencies and lower loan modification volume. As a result we do expect fourth-quarter servicing revenues to be $600 million or slightly lower. Servicing expense increased approximately $25 million quarter on quarter due to investments in control and operational improvements. You will note that this represents a delay in achieving our target of $500 million for the fourth quarter. However, we are doing what is necessary to improve our controls and operational processes and we expect servicing expense to continue to decline through 2015 at a slower pace. MSR risk management was a modest gain of $76 million reflecting regular model updates. On real estate portfolios we added approximately $6.8 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, up from $5 billion in the second quarter. Loan quality remains very strong, we recorded net charge-offs of $81 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the noncredit impaired portfolio, reflecting improvements in home prices as well as delinquencies. Lastly on mortgage, headcount was down approximately 6,000 year to date, meeting our target for the year outlined at Investor Day. And we are on track to reduce it by an incremental 1,000 or so by year end. Turning to page 7, Card, Merchant Services & Auto -- net income of $1.1 billion, down 10% year on year, but up 4% excluding reserve releases with an ROE of 23%, reflecting very strong spend as well as balanced growth of $3 billion year over year. Continuing momentum we saw last quarter as growth and our core business is now outpacing the runoff portfolio. Overall we saw strong and stable revenue of $4.6 billion, flat year on year. Loan growth as well as strong sales volume was offset by spread compression and higher amortization of customer acquisition costs. Expense is up 4% year on year predominately driven by higher [forward] expense related to Home Depot and higher auto lease depreciation. In Card sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 26th consecutive quarter. This industry outperformance is being driven by the value proposition of our core Chase branded and partner products and the investments we are making in customer acquisition, ultimate rewards, marketing and customer service. These investments are driving strong new account originations, up 29%. And the performance of these new accounts, 2013 and 2014 vintages, is exceeding our expectation. In merchant services volume was up 15% year on year driven by continued strong sales performance. But transaction growth was up 6% year on year lagging sales growth, driven by merchant mix and aggregation trends. In auto new vehicle sales continue to grow year over year with the third quarter up 8%. We've seen the 12th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth despite a very competitive market and credit losses continue to be stable and low with the auto pipeline remaining healthy, consistent with a recovery in the auto market. Moving on to credit, the environment remains benign. We continue to see improvements in card early delinquencies and the card net charge-off rate was 252 basis points, an all-time low. This quarter we released $100 million of auto and student lending reserve with no releases in card. During September a new step forward in the evolution of payments was announced, Apple Pay. We are excited to be a key player in a solution that offers improved security and a streamlined customer experience. At the same time we are continuing to develop other innovative payment solutions. Moving on to page 8 and the Corporate & Investment Bank -- CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.8 billion and an ROE of 10% or 14% if you adjust for legal expense. In banking total revenue was $2.7 billion, down 6% year over year. IDCs were $1.5 billion, up 2%, with revenue growth in advisory and equity underwriting fees on strong market activity being offset by lower debt underwriting fees. We maintained our number one ranking in global IDCs per Dealogic with particular strength in ECM in Europe and IPOs globally and we remain a go to bank for large deals and related financing. The ID pipeline is strong with an environment supported of M&A and a strong equity underwriting market. Treasury Services revenue was $1 billion, in line with our guidance, and Lending revenue was down approximately $200 million year on year, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses of over $100 million in this quarter versus modest gains in the prior year on securities received from restructuring. So let's spend a moment on market revenues. The green shoot and the potential upside to our performance that we've been seeing in early September did in fact materialize and our reported markets revenues were up 1% year on year, despite a strong third quarter last year, a quarter in which we significantly outperformed. In fixed income in currencies and emerging markets a strong quarter and a particularly strong September with pickup in both volumes and volatility as currency markets benefited from divergence across global monetary policies, an average quarter for commodities and credit and an improving quarter for rates. In equities we saw quite strong performance for a third quarter in line with last year. Cash was very strong in EMEA on the back of a strong primary market and equity derivatives results were lower versus a record last year, offset by an uptick in prime services revenue on higher balances and continued growth. Of note, customers are taking notice of the progress we've been making in building out our electronic trading platform. And we are seeing strong growth in electronic trading volumes, up 50% in year on year in Europe and nearly 20% in the US. Moving on to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to have completed the sales of our physical commodities business and detailed portfolios, which were major parts of our business simplification agenda and with limited impact on ROE over time. However, these sales will present revenue headwinds in the fourth quarter. And based upon their contributions to last year's results, these will drive an approximately 8% revenue decline year-over-year or approximately $300 million. So outside of the year-over-year decline driven by business exit, we are cautiously optimistic that momentum may carry over. However, October so far has been mixed, likely on the back of a changing market sentiment around the prospect for global growth and inflation. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 8% year on year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits, down quarter on quarter 5% on seasonality. Assets under custody were $21.2 trillion, up 8% year on year. Credit adjustments and other, a positive $240 million, is driven primarily by DVA and FVA as a result of credit spread widening and refinements to certain assumptions. Moving on to expense, total expense was up 21% year on year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter and year to date. Non-comp expense was up 21% year on year primarily driven by legal expense, but down 2% quarter on quarter as increased legal expenses were more than offset by lower cost of business simplification and other expenses. Just quickly on CIB loans, the headline 5% decline for loans is driven by lower client overdraft and trade. Underlying that, traditional credit portfolio and other HFI loans were up by over 10%. Moving on to page 9 and Commercial Banking -- the quarter saw net income of $649 million on revenue of $1.7 billion with a strong ROE of 18%. Revenue was down 3% from the prior year and 2% sequentially, reflecting yield compression in our lending book as well as business simplification, partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Expense of $668 million was in line with guidance and relatively flat year on year and quarter on quarter, despite ongoing investments in controls. Loan balances increased $1.6 billion in the quarter driven by continued strong performance in our commercial real estate businesses. CRE loans increased 13% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter, both in excess of the industry, and our CRE book has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. C&I loans were relatively flat from the prior quarter, broadly in line with industry trends. Of note, deposits increased $5 billion in the quarter, mostly in Middle Market and corporate client banking. This is reflective of our clients still managing with very high levels of liquidity. Having said that, utilization rates were up slightly for the quarter and pipelines continue to move incrementally higher across the board. Outside of lending we continue to make good progress in building our core franchise. This quarter growth investment banking revenue was approximately $500 million, up 12% from last year, and on a year-to-date basis the commercial bank has generated $1.4 billion of investment banking revenues for the Firm up 22%. Card and merchant services revenue increased 7% from the prior year. And finally, since this time last year we've added approximately 500 new clients in targeted industries. Overall credit performance remains strong with net charge-offs of only 1 basis point, marking the seventh consecutive quarter with net charge-offs in the single-digit or very low or recoveries. As you think about the coming quarter, we do expect returns to continue. We would like to remind you of the one-time proceeds of approximately $100 million that we received in the fourth quarter of last year from a lending-related workout. Moving on to page 10, Asset Management -- an excellent quarter in asset management with record net income of $572 million, up 20% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter with a 25% ROE and a 31% pretax margin, in line with our through the cycle target. For the full year we expect these ratios to below our through the cycle target. You will see that we changed from reporting our revenue by client segment to reporting revenue by line of business to be consistent with how we manage the business. So we are introducing sub line of business results for revenues in global investment management and global wealth management. Overall revenue of $3 billion was up 9% year on year, reflecting an increase in management fees driven by long-term net inflows, including $16 billion this quarter. This marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 11% year on year. While we continue to see strength in our multi-asset and fixed income flows equity flows were flat this quarter. Asset Management expense of $2.1 billion was up 4% from a year ago and up modestly 1% versus last quarter. In banking we reported strong performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances up 16% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter with growth coming from both our US and our international markets and a solid pipeline for demands for the remainder of the year. Deposits were also a record, up 9% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter. Lastly as reported, client assets of $2.3 trillion were up 4% year on year and down 5% quarter on quarter. However as part of business simplification we closed the sale of the RPS business during this quarter, recognizing a small gain reflected in [GIM]. Excluding the impact of the RPS sale client assets would have been up 10% year on year and flat quarter on quarter. Moving on to page 11 and Corporate and Private Equity -- Private Equity reported $71 million of net income driven by net violation gains including a small net gain related to the portfolio sale in OEP which we announced in the quarter, predominantly offset by related expenses. Year to date the portfolio balance is down by approximately $2.5 billion and with the sale we expect it to be down by about $4 billion by year end. Treasury and CIO reported a small net loss of $30 million with NII slightly positive in the quarter, and other corporate net income at $357 million; included in this result were a tax-related benefit of approximately $400 million, as I previously mentioned, as well as approximately $500 million pretax of legal expense with the remainder of the Firm wide legal expense principally in the IB. At the Firm level our tax rate for the quarter was 28%, broadly in line with a normalized tax rate of 30% plus or minus. Nondeductible legal expenses in CIB were offset by tax benefits here and other corporate. Before moving on to our outlook page, Firm NII was up approximately $320 million quarter on quarter driven by lower interest expense in CIB and core NII was up approximately $110 million. Moving on to page 12 -- you can see on the page our current outlook which I've already addressed throughout the presentation. Wrapping up, a strong result for a third quarter despite legal expense of $1 billion after-tax. This reflects the strength of each of our franchises and the benefit of the diversified business model. We have made substantial progress against our control and regulatory agenda as well as business simplification, albeit with more work to do. And we have successfully executed against our 2014 target of capital leverage and liquidity. As I have shown you today, the investments we are making in our businesses are fueling growth and underpinning strong earnings now and in the future and we remain focused on serving our customers and safeguarding their assets and our Company. With that, operator, please open up the lines for Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, so, Matt, I would say we I think -- and I can't remember which quarter it was, but several quarters ago we put a slide out in the presentation that showed what -- it was last year -- showed what the business simplification agenda looked like. I think if you go back and now look at what we have done, including what we were able to either complete or sign this quarter, OEP, the RPS business, GSOG, Commodities, we've certainly broken the back of most of the business simplification agenda. Having said that, it is an ongoing process and we continue to de-risk clients and industries and continue to simplify our products in mortgage and the like. So I would characterize that the actions that we have taken by the end of this year are substantially all of them. But at the margin we continue to look at client by client product by product to simplify things.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, we have talked before about the fact that when you take into consideration a combination of the leverage and liquidity rules together with our own point of view on positioning the Company for rising rates. So therefore our own point of view as being under invested in the duration perspective, that we have, we believe, a relatively optimized balance sheet. Although it likes like we have a significant amount of cash, that is in part non-operating deposits that at some point will either flow out or be adequately paid for by the client return and in other parts is part of our overall liquidity. I mentioned that subsequent to the US LCR rules being made final that although we had been reporting previously against Basel compliance in the 20%-plus range, so a buffer of 20%-plus. The US rules are more punitive in a number of ways, most notably that they look at peak outflows in 30 days relevant cumulative and also on higher outflow assumptions across the categories. Given that we are not compliant with a more modest buffer. So we would say that we are largely optimized.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, the capital is relatively minimal in comparison to the overall Firm. So while it obviously is positive for us, it is not a noteworthy number. And the expenses, just to note that I said the ROE is limited over time; this is a business that was still being built and therefore hadn't yet reached a maturity stage or a stage where it was returning its hurdle. It will take a little bit more time to take the expenses out so there will be a slight lag in removing expenses. So in the fourth quarter it will be more modest, but over time it would be a large chunk of that $300 million.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So we had a better third quarter than we had been expecting earlier in the quarter. We will see how the fourth quarter pans out. So, yes, it is the case that if we have a better fourth quarter and therefore a stronger second half of the year that our expectations for comp will be higher. They'll still be well within our comp to revenue ratio range of 30% to 35%, I mean you saw for the quarter 32% year to date the same. So in large part it is going to be based on higher revenues in market. This quarter we also had higher revenues in mortgage and also in corporate. So that is the principal driver.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, sorry.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Before I do that, you had a second part to your question on the cost of controls. Let me just deal with that very quickly. We talked about the fact that we expect our control cost to reach a peak this year, that is still the case. So I would say that they are substantially in our run rate by the end of the year. They will over time be able to come down; they will still remain elevated relative to historical because that is the new business world we are in. But we are going to be able to become more efficient, automate things, finish remediations, look backs. So over time that will provide leverage. In terms of looking out to 2015 and 2016, while we haven't given specific guidance I will just point you to a few things. The first is we do expect to continue to see mortgage servicing expense decline on the back of delinquency and credit trends. We would also expect to see improvements in the production space albeit we are -- there is a reasonable fixed cost base. But nevertheless, as you saw this quarter, we continue to make great progress in resizing that expense base. In the nonmortgage space in the consumer bank, Gordon has committed to $1 billion in 2016 over 2014 principally but not exclusively driven by automation and efficiencies in branch staffing leverage and also the branch footprint optimization. And then while we didn't quantify it, Daniel is very much looking at the expense equation for positive leverage that is reasonably significant over the next two years in the CIB. So I would say across the board obviously we are growing in asset management, we are investing in our businesses notwithstanding.
MARIANNE LAKE: So at the beginning what I did say is that there are a number of masses in our legal expenses for the quarter, but in large part it does relate to FX. And consequently you can read into that that things are further progressed this quarter than last, but obviously we can't comment any further.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just to talk about it, so we did $1.5 billion of buybacks this quarter, same last quarter. Obviously we have another $2 billion to go in terms of our approval. We don't know what the rule is going to be, it will come out before the end of the year, we will have to see what that says. There will be a transition timeline, it will transition on the same timeline phase and timeline that the rest of the buffers transition in on, so through to January 1, 2019. So there is no need for us to overreact and race to compliance. So we would do much as we have done over the course of the last two years, which is balance continuing to make good progress getting to wherever it is that we need to be, which we are not going to get at at this moment, against the desire to want to continue to deliver capital to the shareholders in the form of increased dividends and repurchases.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO .: Remember, you all have the forecast where CET1 goes up to 10.5%, 10.8% or something like that. When that new CCAR rules come out we'll probably go fine-tune what it might look like at the end of 2015.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean the reality of the situation is sitting at 10.1%; we are in good company with the rest of the industry in the context that just given how CCAR operates it is highly likely that there will be overall accretion to capital in the industry over the course of 2015 and we will be no exception. So we will continue to accrete capital up towards and potentially above our 10.5%. But we are not going to recalibrate a target until we understand the rules.
MARIANNE LAKE: And (multiple speakers) one thing on the target, just when you see the rules yourself know that in our 50 to 100 basis point buffer the reason why we had a range was to allow in part for some of uncertainty and things evolving. And so, we would obviously want to fine-tune and put a finer point on our buffer. So it is possible that our buffer may not be as high as 100% too. So we will deal with all of that when the rules come out.
JAMIE DIMON: And we have also been, remember, very careful the purpose here is to protect and grow the client franchise, meet the regulatory agenda and then we will adjust to all of these changes as they take place. The big ones we're going to know by the end of the year, TLAC, G-SIB and new CCAR.
MARIANNE LAKE: CCAR, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you would have seen our other where it came down slightly in the quarter from the second quarter on the back of model improvement and on data and portfolio runoff. So we are starting to see that bend now. It is the case that as we project forward to the end of 2015 the number that we showed you at Investor Day is still relatively good. It is probably a little higher than that. We said [1.5%] it will be support between 1.5% and 1.55% by the end of next year. We are not in complete control around the timing of model approvals. We obviously are doing everything we can to be timely and then the regulators need adequate time to approve them. So we have kind of been a little bit more conservative potentially about the duration it takes to get models approved. But we are still on that same basic trajectory.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, yes, there is a significant benefit. If you look at our disclosures you can kind of see the short end versus long end impact. Basically there is a significant benefit coming off of the short end. So we would expect to capture a significant portion of that in the first 12 months. But we obviously are looking for a more normal curve overall over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Obviously not to comment on everybody else's results, but our results were -- in terms of the size of the economic downturn, they were relatively in line. And our results were relatively in line with a few minor sort of enhancements to our process. So we weren't actually looking for materially changed results in our midyear DFAST. So obviously we haven't had instructions yet, we are expecting them absolutely eminently, possibly as early as this week. In terms of guidance from the regulators on how to think about the bank holding company scenario for 2015 CCAR, to the degree that there are more and more stressful idiosyncratic losses or stresses on leverage or other things it could have an impact. But we have to wait and see.
JAMIE DIMON: So, Mark Carney of the FSB and the Bank of England Chairman said that two major things remain to finish kind of the too big to fail issues. One is how you deal with derivatives and the second is TLAC, and both of those will be done this year. This is the thing, has been done, it is a great example -- I think it was 18 firms who got together and came up in a very complex way globally had to deal with this in a way that the regulators. And the Fed put out a press release and Mark Carney has been very positive about it and it was industry led. So we do think it does solve that issue. So all of the buy side will do it. It will be -- eventually all the sell side -- I mean the other way around, all the buy side will eventually want to do it because it is actually better for the business as a whole. May be not better for one trading desk, but it is better for the business as a whole and it is a little coercive. So that the regulators are basically saying that to do further derivatives you are going to have to adopt these new rules. And we think over time a lot of people will do it.
MARIANNE LAKE: And just one thing there, the [GA] team does sort of break the back of the problem, but we are still awaiting actual regulatory guidance. So there is still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader and we would encourage it to be broader, if nothing else for simplicity purposes, not necessarily because the GA team alone don't really achieve the results.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. And we're also in a position where even if the buy side doesn't for some reason, that we would be able to manage that risk over time and it would diminish over time because they're the short duration of the derivatives.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, I mean, our repo business is, as you know, substantially client driven and our clients are very interested in ensuring that they are giving us sufficient wallets to allow us to dedicate sufficient balance sheet to their business. So in that sense we continue to see repo as a strategic product for our client and a scarce resource, quite frankly. So, it is obviously the case that as we understand new rules that meanwhile leverage rules have been for a while and we've seen leverage reduce in the industry overall. But we continue to have a strong and healthy repo business.
JAMIE DIMON: We are okay with the higher margins, generalized margin rules. And if they go to kind of a tri-party CCP thing that will be fine too. And it would alleviate other issues at that point in time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean between the CCP and I think the FSC even put out a framework last night that talked about cross industry including nonfinancial standardized higher levels of haircut that we are supportive of. So I think the combination of those two things achieve a great deal.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, I mean I think, Betsy, we would -- we will do exactly with this what we have done with everyone else to date which is overall we are only going to put our balance sheet to work and allow our clients to use it if the overall relationship over time pays us a sufficient return for that. We have the ability to do that somewhat methodically and so we are being very surgical and very strategic about how we use our balance sheet. But it is a core strategic product for many of our clients and they want to continue to be able to do that. So, yes, we could, I mean if you look at the numbers, however you want to cut them, there is -- within our repo business we do have a match book, we have inventory financing as well, we have client suites in our short-term wholesale funding. So there are things we could do, we just don't want to overreact.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So, I mean we talked before and you will see more over the coming few months about our own wallet and payment capability so [Chase pay] and Quick Checkout where we would provide the capability for our customers to be able to have a much more seamless experience. Also for merchants to have a lower abandonment rate and continuing with the safety and security of tokenization and other methods. So we are continuing to work on our own proprietary wallet and payment capabilities that will be piloted and then subsequently launched over the course of the next coming months. And then as obviously the case that we are out of pilot and in production on our end-to-end capability including [Chase net]. So we are signing up merchants at a faster rate than we expected and, again, you will hear more about that later. But our ability to now negotiate bilaterally economics with merchants and provide customers with compelling reasons to continue to bring share to us is also something we are working on.
JAMIE DIMON: So our basic philosophy has been that you, the customer, who want to be able to use your debit cards, your credit cards in a way that you want and that we want to make it available to you whether it is Apple Pay, in-store apps, other people's wallets, Visa wallet, our own wallet -- all which will have benefits, etc. And as Marianne said, we think that we can also be friendly to merchants with data, with pricing, with simplified contracts. So we are trying to make this an ecosystem that works better for everybody and is far more secure. I have customers on both sides and I'm far more secure.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I was just estimating it, I was taking a guess that it will double over the next four or five years.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I think it is fair to say, Betsy, that what we are seeing inside the space, not surprisingly, is this relentless constant and evolving set of attacks and we need to be constantly evolving and constantly vigilant in response. So it is entirely reasonable to assume that we will continue to increase our investment over the course of the next several years and we'll -- so it will be larger and we will let you know.
JAMIE DIMON: I should clarify that was quoted in the press not accurately because this is one area where the government and businesses have been collaborating really well. And for a long time of course all these government agencies -- and I think we need that because the government sees all kind of attacks and they have a -- they are a fountain of information. And then also the industry itself collaborates, which is we share information with other banks immediately when we see something happening. So maybe even if something happens to you, you can help one of your brethren avoid a problem like that. And then cyber goes beyond just yourself. It's making sure that all of your vendors you deal with have proper cyber control, that all the exchanges have proper cyber control. So this is -- we have identified this as a huge effort. We've been very good at it until this recent breach, which we are not going to make excuses for. We will invest any and all things we need to do to get it right. Our customers are protected, which is critical, but we don't want these things to be happening. But it is going to be a battle. We have already seen a lot of very, very serious -- far more serious than personal data being taken where Social Security numbers, security codes, account numbers, etc. And we do think that unfortunately there are going to be some wins and losses in this. This is not going to be one of those things where it is going to be absolute and we don't want to be sitting here saying you can absolutely be protected because we think that will put you in a false sense of security.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. Tokenization will be more broadly used and that avoids a certain type of fraud, but not other types of fraud. So you have to look at each one of these things and say, what does it accomplish.
MARIANNE LAKE: And that certainly helps across the payment space, but there are other areas of vulnerability, obviously.
JAMIE DIMON: And there is (inaudible) security about who came to what systems, when they use private computers with private lines as opposed to public computers from home. There are all these things we're all doing and we've had some great people come in, audit us, and this is one area I suggest to most companies, get someone to come in who is an expert at this. We have our own attacker system where we have our own people trying to get through. So we are always trying to look where we might have a weak spot.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think it makes it less attractive. For the one reason if you look at one contract that someone may have in one fund or someone like that yes, it may make it slightly less attractive. But if you look at the improved safety of the system I think it makes it more attractive. So, if people believe that doing this makes whole system safer, every institution will say well, on the one contract side I would prefer to have the optionality, but for the total I like the fact the system is protected and we have time to work all this out.
JAMIE DIMON: So if the resolution works that is really, really good for everybody. I mean everybody would have preferred that there was a resolution process in place for Lehman. The pain and suffering would have been far less across derivatives even though they didn't have the same -- they had more protection derivatives at the time.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think just an important point of clarification for what it is worth is that the FDIC found the industry's 2013 plans not credible, the Fed did not. So it wasn't a joint agency conclusion that point. And so, we haven't had comments on the 2014 plan yet. Having said that we, talking for JPMorgan , we made substantial progress even between the 2013 and 2014 submissions. We are in dialogue with our regulators to understand even more detail of what they found as being the limitations or the vulnerabilities in our credibility of the plan. And we are committed to remediating them by 2015. It has had little bearing on our business simplification agenda because it was already a very broad and appropriate agenda. But we continue to work on all number of things around the place, [crystal] operations, legal entity simplification and we will continue to do so.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember the FSB led by Mark Carney has made it -- be said publicly that the two big remaining pieces are TLAC, which should be done this year, and the derivative stay that would be common harmonization around the globe. And those two pieces are going to be in place and make resolution much more achievable.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right and we should add that obviously the [Issa] protocol was specifically pointed out in that feedback and the industry voluntarily resolved the issue I think very well.
MARIANNE LAKE: No. So I mean, my point of view on this is that while we have started doing the filing more recently we have been well aware of the requirement for a reasonably long if not very long period of time and have reoriented our business to be compliant in substance with the requirements. So the fact that we are producing metrics at this point isn't having meaningful impact on our business. It is the case that over the course of the next year between now and the compliance date next July, we do expect to, as an industry, receive feedback on that data and we will have to see how that progresses. But it is our point of view that our business is compliant.
JAMIE DIMON: Industry wide as people pushed LCR and capital and some of these rules down to the trading desk that we did see a reduction in inventories, etc. But our view is that market making is a critical role in society and it has to take place. We have 16,000 clients and so we really do focus on serving those clients. We electrified more of it, some of it will go to clearinghouses, some of it will be -- but we want to be there for the clients. And you will see how the industry sorts out. Some people in the industry are making much more drastic decisions than others. Our decision has been to be there to make markets and just try to adjust to the new rules which may make it a little bit more costly to trade.
JAMIE DIMON: I think it wasn't the reporting requirements, I think it was pushing down of LCR, the cost of capital, the cost of debt and the traders reduced their balance sheets a little bit and they were a little more cautious how they use a balance sheet. And that is industry wide. And then some people said we simply can't stay in these areas. I have seen people exit certain trading areas.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, repo is a good example of that where the level of, not concern, but the level of dialogue with clients around our willingness to continue to commit our balance sheet to that business has increased because others are less willing. And so, we are seeing some of that for sure.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, okay so let me give you the down piece of it. One of them is not timing, it is just a continuation of a trend where trade finance loans are down substantially year over year (technical difficulty). And so when you look at it the overall loan balance is being impacted by trade, markedly. And then on the client overdraft side, that is something that is a little bit lumpier, you see. So those two things driving it down. But the point to the comment was a little bit -- not to trivialize reported loan growth, which was still positive, but with those masking underlying performance in our credit portfolio and HFI loans. So our more traditional credit lending continues to grow and grow at 10% plus pace.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think a reasonable point of view on that would be at the lower end of that range, at the 50 basis points. So remember, when we -- obviously we will refine it and we will update you. But when we have thoughts about having a buffer it is there in order to protect us from a range of issues including capital volatility driven by AOCI. We regularly and routinely stress our portfolio to understand how much stress we could see in AOCI in a short period of time and that is going to be one of the principal drivers. So I would say is that a reasonable sort of benchmark for the level that we would go to. That doesn't mean we have to have that buffer in totality. As I said, buffers phase in between now and January of 2019. So whatever we decide it is, however we communicate that to you, that as well of all of the other buffers, capital conservation buffer and G-SIB we will phase in.
JAMIE DIMON: And CCAR may still be a limiting factor, so --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I mean the reality -- as Jamie said, the reality is that the way CCAR is operating, while there has been good progress in the communication and dialogue with the regulator, the reality remains that it is still not clear, either quantitatively or qualitatively, exactly how everything is working and therefore it is unlikely to be the case that in this cycle that you are going to see 100% or greater than 100% distribution. That is my view.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so, I mean, just before we sort of get onto the business-by-business lens on it, I mean the reality mathematically is obviously true that if we have higher capital we would prima facie defacto have lower returns. But the reality hasn't been that way over time. So you know acutely that we have added significant capital over the last however many years and have been able to, over time, continue to reorient the business and optimize against it to deliver strong returns. So could there be a decline in returns. Obviously we will have to see what the rules look like. Clearly at the moment the most clear and present danger relates to higher G-SIB surcharges on short-term wholesale funding. So in the first quarter impact of it would obviously have an impact on directing those businesses and products in the CIB. But obviously if the Company is holding more capital we will look more broadly. But I don't think it is a foregone conclusion that you are going to see a pro rata decline in our returns. And obviously we are continuing to focus on our expenses in making sure that the overall business is as efficient as possible.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean our 10% ROE, 13% ROTCE, remember the target is an ROTCE target. It's obviously -- right now in 2014 we are in a bit of a cyclical low in a number of ways and elevated expenses. So it is cyclical lows in mortgage, at least for the first half of the year cyclical lows and some secular headwinds in the market space. Yes, we are reaching a peak in terms of control expenses, so that is in part contributing reserve releases are lower albeit that credit remains benign, but at a relative matter they are lower. But we are staring efficiencies in the face across our businesses over the course of the next two years. So control costs will decline, CCB will deliver improvements in expense, CIB will also, rates will be a meaningful piece. Clearly you've seen our sensitivity to rising rates is relatively significant, but it is not the only piece. When the economy generally recovers, when loan growth recovers and volatility recovers, all those things, good things happen.
MARIANNE LAKE: Just to talk about what will be included in CCAR, the truth is we don't know. So what you have seen we have also read. But that doesn't constitute any kind of guidance. We haven't received guidance yet, so we are going to have to wait to see that. It wouldn't be entirely surprising if there was some sort of leverage stress in there quantitatively; I can't speak to qualitatively. And then, yes, there has been more stringent guidance on leverage lending from the regulators over the course of the last year. And we have taken a fairly strict line on applying that. So it has in part been one of the reasons why we believe we have seen lower loan growth in some of our business than we would otherwise have seen.
JAMIE DIMON: And it is going to get a little stricter on the refi part of the leverage loans. And obviously whatever the terms are, we will meet the terms and some of that business will go to nonbanks or some banks who are not regulated by the OCC and the Fed.
MARIANNE LAKE: It is still relative to 20-million-something customers in -- households and 23 million, something like that, households in the retail sales space is still relatively low. From recollection, and we will check the numbers for you, I think it is in that 2 million to 3 million range. But nevertheless -- no?
JAMIE DIMON: Mobile was much higher than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Mobile is higher? Okay, we will get back to you.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry --.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, it is 18 million out of --.
MARIANNE LAKE: 18 million.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know is that individuals or households? It's a huge amount.
MARIANNE LAKE: Customers.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, customers.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, again, our view is to, if you are a client and you want to use your Apple phone to pay with NFC at a merchant, that is fine, we don't want to say you can't use your JPMorgan Chase credit card or debit card. And like we said, we're going to be in other people's wallets too. And we're going to have our own which we think will have some competitive advantage. So will it cannibalize? Sure. But we are not against cannibalizing our own business or disrupting ourselves if we are building a better business and are gaining share. Our goal to gain share. We do believe a little bit in -- you know when Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity, we want to be the people that are coming up with the new ideas and stuff that are getting more of our customers using our stuff and happier. And if it reduces certain margins somewhere, so be it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, look, if you look at year-over-year trends, they continue to be in the -- I mean I think the first quarter year over year was 4%, 8% in the second, 7% in the third. I think we are not expecting those year-over-year tends to decelerate. Obviously quarter over quarter things can be impacted just by the timing of closing loans. So fundamentally I would say, no, we aren't seeing significant deceleration quarter over quarter within continued relative momentum. Solid across the board with obviously more challenges in the C&I space.
MARIANNE LAKE: Relative to the 58 plus or minus that [was being said], no, it is principally in higher revenues on higher market performance.
JAMIE DIMON: We always said that might be the case.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: So we are meeting our overhead numbers and the comp itself will bounce around a little bit. Remember, in the old days we used to break out IB comp in total for that reason. But --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, sorry.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So just in terms of what is our binding constraint at the moment, it is CET1, so Basel III advanced capital, risk-based capital at the margin. So it is not to say that the other ratios leverage liquidity and the like aren't [comfortably] around it. But that -- and even stress capital. But that is currently our binding constraint. It is very hard for us to give us a point of view where you should do this new model three years out when we are staring potentially new rules in the face in the next two months. As I said earlier, we are expecting over the course of the next 12 months that we will continue to accrete capital at 2% or above our 10.5% which is basically in-line with what you guys all have in your models. Beyond that it is our expectation that, hopefully anyway, putting new rules aside that by the time we are in our fourth or fifth cycle of CCAR when you've made substantial industry wide progress in the sort of non-quantitative aspects of CCAR where we have more credible resolutions and the like that we will be able to me more aggressive in our ability to seek capital distribution capability. So outside of any changes in rules we would hope at the end of 2015 into 2016 CCAR to be able to have -payout ratios are much higher. But we will have to see.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, there is. So about half of that I would call -- approximately half of that I would call relatively normal, but included in that result there is actually a one-time item associated with accounting for the previous interest accrual that we released in the quarter, which is one time. You should expect that interest expense to go back up next quarter to something more normal.
MARIANNE LAKE: A little less than $100 million.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yeah. So I think -- yes, it is our -- it is our belief that we should be able to manage the ratio to be stable to improving over time, ultimately getting down to something much more in the mid-50%, but that is dependent on revenue growth associated with rates but not limited to rates. So in the absence of rate but, by the way just to point out, that it is still our case that based upon continued improvement in the domestic rate economy that rates will start to rise in the middle of next year. But having said that, even without rates we would hope to be able to continue to maintain the discipline to have that ratio be broadly flat to down.
MARIANNE LAKE: So since we talked about the $100 billion estimated deposit outflows associated with liquidity draining out of the system, remember that was predicated on believing that it was possible that the Fed would use the reverse repo program much more -- in much more size than is likely to be the case today for two reasons. One is that obviously they have made changes to the term deposit facility that allows them to now be LCR eligible, which is helpful in terms of providing another tool in their toolkit. And the second is that in September, as you know, the RRP was capped in total at $300 billion. That cap may or may not be permanent. I'm sure it will be recalibrated over time. But it looks like it will be unlikely to reach the $1 billion that would have driven the $100 billion -- the $100 billion -- sorry the $1 trillion that would have driven the $100 billion. So. you can make your decision about whether it is $300 million or $500 million in the fullness of time and scale our operating deposit outflows back relative to that, knowing of course that it is already in operation at $300 billion right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, Brennan, we haven't disclosed that. I would -- a large chunk of it is client driven, that is what we will say.
MARIANNE LAKE: A large chunk -- a larger chunk of it -- the larger chunk of it.
JAMIE DIMON: We have also lengthened the firm financing part of it --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: -- to be more compliant with LCR, etc.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would square it in two ways. The first is already did have a better performance in the third quarter then would have been anticipated in our previous guidance given that that guidance was given during the sort of harder times of the second quarter. So that is already in our run rate so to speak in terms of the comp that would accrue to that. And then if you sort of go back and, in the fullness of time, look at the transcript, I did say if the performance continues into the fourth quarter. So it will depend. We have always said, and evidently maybe we should strip out comp from our adjusted expenses. But we have always said that the adjusted expense absolute number in any period is obviously going to be calibrated to the performance of the market-related businesses. And clearly you would wave in good revenues every day at a 32% comp to revenue ratio. So that is really all we were saying, nothing more subtle than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, no, it is not possible to talk about it in any more detail, I am afraid.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's just -- suffice to say that we are working with a number of regulators across a number of jurisdictions.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you are right that when you roll forward beyond the first 12 months you do get the benefit of being able to continue to reinvest deposits as they mature up the curve in terms of their invest -- the underlying investment. So that is the compounding effect of what you are seeing in our earnings and risk shock. But what we showed I think in -- I'm going to cease to recall it, but maybe it was in the Barclays conference in 2013 -- is that you would expect once rates start to rise, if they rise in a somewhat expected fashion. So obviously it depends on what rate [party] you want to put on that, that you could expect the cumulative NII to be in our [impact] in three to four years.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember the benefit is more for the first hundred, a little bit less the second hundred, a little bit less the third hundred, a little bit less the fourth hundred, because there is increasing repricing of deposits at that level. And we don't know exactly what the yield curve will be four years out, but --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: And also we do embed in that our own estimates of competition and repricing.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: But --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. That is a very good point actually, Brennan. Our scenario does contemplate not only a more normal loan to deposit ratio, more normal interest bearing versus non-interest-bearing deposit and also a higher (inaudible) on retail deposits just given the LCR competitive dynamics, technology advances and the like. So to the best of our ability we've tried to bake that in and that is included in our number.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. So the deposit -- so in part not totality, in part the deposits that were likely to outflow through the RRP were non-operating deposits. And non-operating deposits we do not count for significant liquidity value in the Firm; we fundamentally have them on deposit at central banks at the Fed. And so, if they stay -- we will come back to whether we would be willing to let them stay, but if they stay they will continue to basically be treated in that way. And they are not included in terms of our assumption around asset sensitivity and forward-looking NII. Obviously over time we are in the same way as we talked about repo we are looking at non-operating deposits for our clients in the context of their overall relationship. And so, that is another valuable use of our balance sheet with leverage capital and the like against it. And in the fullness of time we will expect the overall relationship to pay for that. But we are going to wait and see some of those dynamics play out. So other than that I'll just go back to the earlier comments I made that we do have a high level of HQLA, not in [cash], not in securities, but it is in order to make sure that we have adequate liquidity both under our own stresses most importantly, but also under LCR and NSFR. And we feel good and at modest buffers relative to them.
JAMIE DIMON: At the typical quarter end a lot of large clients leave a lot of deposits here which obviously are not necessarily good for us in terms of LCR or capital, etc., and we will be looking at how we manage those client relationships over time too.
JAMIE DIMON: The other thing you remember of the securities portfolio is that as rates go up the duration of that extends on its own.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct.
JAMIE DIMON: And so, we will be managing that. And, yes, we might invest it longer at one point, but we are in a very conservative position right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we are continuing to see credit trends improve, delinquencies come down, modification pipelines -- all the metrics are coming down. Obviously they are coming down from a much smaller place this year than that were last and the year before. So the pace of improvement or the relative pace is slower. But we are expecting that to continue down through $500 million and into the $400 million's in 2015. And then just more longer-term, you know that we are focused on ensuring that through the next cycle we have a smaller delinquency portfolio. And so, a more normal level would be substantially less than this.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry, that is a longer-term view.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean we talked last quarter about the fact that we had loss share, a combination of things, primarily our strategy around the government mortgage space but also a little bit of share in the what I would call in our target segment. So we have made that back. So in some part it is just continue to leverage our balance sheet properly, do very granular marginal pricing to really focus on changing and improving our customer operating processes. So across the board we just continue to get very granular and try and be as competitive as we can.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, just to be very clear, it may be slightly -- (inaudible) slightly higher than Investor Day in terms of our guidance. So, look, obviously any guidance that we give you, and no good deed goes unpunished, but any guidance we give you is always predicated on based upon what we know today. And so, if something changes that would change that point of view we will obviously have to recalibrate it. But just prima fascia having the requirement to have extra long-term debt or loss absorbing capital and/or capital wouldn't necessarily prima fascia change the overall RWA we have. I mean you have to be careful to ensure that by having higher levels of capital there's not an incentive to want to stretch in the credit box, but we have very tight credit discipline. So I wouldn't see that being a material change in the outlook. But obviously if there is a change in rules that directly affect RWA that would do.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean, look, it is the case that a lot of refinancing has already happened, so the debt maturity wall is smaller, although rates are lower than we may have expected at this point in time. So I would -so, therefore yes, it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be some continued headwinds. But having said that, I think there is going to be windows of opportunity. So we are going to -- M&A and ECM are more constructive and likely to be buoyant, but I think debt capital market still has windows of opportunity.
JAMIE DIMON: Folks, thank you very much for joining us -MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.",-0.029999999999999805,0.20500000000000104,1,0.09246703521739509,0.10262317052392068
24,Q2_2008,"
MIKE CAVANAGH, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Good morning, everybody. It's Mike and Jamie here. We're going to do the usual so you've got a presentation available to you on our website that I will walk through all the businesses and then Jamie and I will take some Q&A. If you go to the presentation, I just want to start right off the bat on page one for the sake of clarity throughout all the numbers, just explain right up front how the accounting for the Bear Stearns acquisition, which closed during the quarter, affects all the numbers throughout the presentation, and really I'm going to hit this quickly and simply reference you back to what we said the last time we gave you an update here in mid-May. For anybody who has detailed follow-ups we can take that offline. Working through the big items here, first of all, the extraordinary gains, there isn't one. It's zero. We talked about that being possibly as much as $1 billion in May, down from our earlier estimates. So obviously deteriorated a bit from where we expected to be in May but for the same reasons we described there at the time we gave the guidance in May. So all it really means is, we in the pricing of the deal, we had cushion and which we ended up in fact needing, and used all that up in the deleveraging and accounting for the deal and reserving associated with it. The next big item is just merger-related items that run through the operating results of the company for the quarter, which totaled $540 million, and we're putting all of those in corporate and that compares with $500 million after tax that we had expected or talked about at the time of our last update in mid-May. That again breaks down into two pieces, equity pickup for the shares we owned for the month pre-the-close of $423 million (corrected by company after the call) and other merger-related items, I think merger expenses and other things of $117 million after tax. So those are the above the line items of $540 million that's Bear Stearns related. You think about, we talked also at the last update about merger costs and merger related expenses that continue past this quarter. We talked about that number being as high as $900 million after tax, bringing that guidance down a bit, it will probably come out to be something more in the neighborhood of about $500 million after tax over time. It will be lumpy. You can think of it being maybe up to $150 million after tax or so per quarter for the second half of the year and then trend down over time beyond that in '09 and after. Beyond that, though, the real point is that we continue to be very confident that the ongoing businesses we've picked up, prime services, equity, et cetera, are going to contribute on a go-forward basis, the $1 billion plus after tax of annualized earnings by the time we get ramped back up and exit '09 going into 2010, so continue to be confident about that. And then last point is just geography of all this. As I said, we put the merger-related expenses for the quarter and in future go in corporate, but the ongoing activities, that $1 billion of earnings that we'll ramp up to will appear in the Investment Bank and Asset Management businesses where the Bear Stearns businesses went. Last point on just the merger-related items, we talked about derisking the balance sheet that we took over from Bear Stearns. So we're very pleased with the progress we've made on that score. Risk weighted assets, which we calculated under our message of about $220 billion or so, reduced by 45% or so as of the June 30th reporting date and VAR reduced, Bear Stearns VAR reduced by about 70%. So to sum up at the bottom what it all means, the total income of the company after tax was $2 billion or $0.54. That includes in it what I described above, the $540 million of merger-related items or $0.15 worth, leaving us with results ex the Bear Stearns items of $2.5 billion after tax. Moving on to page two, I'm sure you've read all this. These are the highlights from our press release, identifying special credit reserving items and marks underlying growth across the businesses and strong capital position so I'm going to save this and go through this as we roll through the presentation. So let's skip past slide 2 as well as slide 3 which just tabulates the numbers for you on a consolidated basis and go straight to the Investment Bank's results which we'll dive into in detail on slide 4. If you see here on slide 4, we had profits in the investment bank after tax of $394 million on revenue of $5.5 billion. The June results for Bear Stearns are included in these numbers, and the overall results in the Investment Bank would have been a bit better but for that, so there's a little bit of a drag from Bear Stearns' results for the month of June in the Investment Bank, though we expect that to turn around and make a positive contribution in the second half of the year. Working down the revenue components of the Investment Bank, you see we had a $1.7 billion of Investment Banking fees, the circled number over there, which is our second highest quarterly performance of all time. So obviously we feel very, very pleased with the continued strength of our investment banking corporate finance and advisory franchise and you'll see some of the rankings on the next page. Moving down, Fixed Income markets, $2.4 billion, 2.3, down slightly from a year ago, which is very strong, despite the fact that in these numbers, we took markdowns of about $700 million on leveraged loans, which I'll go through in a second, and markdowns of about $400 million on mortgage related positions we have in the Investment Bank. Clearly, offset by very strong performance in rates, currencies and some other businesses, emerging markets and credit trading as well and slight positive, $165 million related to widening of our credit spreads on structured notes in the Fixed Income business. Equity Markets, a $1.1 billion, down a bit from a year ago, total revenues, also in there $150 million of benefit from widening of credit spreads. Moving down to the next circled number you see there, credit costs of $398 million, so we added -- is essentially no charge-offs in the quarter, net recoveries, actually, slight net recoveries, but we added about $400 million to allowance for loan losses, given the deteriorating trends in some of the names in the portfolio and that brings our overall loan loss allowance to average loans you see it averaging 3.19% at the end of the quarter, that's 3.35%. Extremely strong, up from 2.55% at the end of last quarter and you'll see that across other businesses as well. Continuing down, you see expenses of $4.7 billion, up over the prior year, in part due to Bear Stearns but primarily due to the high comp to revenue ratio in the quarter, which you see as 57%. That brings us to year-to-date comps revenue of 52% which we think positions us properly, given the environment that we're faced with and the performance year-to-date and we'll obviously see what the second half of the year brings. Lastly, we had a benefit in the tax line that contributed to net income being about flat to pretax income. And lastly, on VAR, you see $142 million is our VAR calculation for the quarter, $139 million spot at the end of the quarter, up only slightly from the $122 million that JPMorgan had alone at the end of last quarter, so that speaks to the derisking that we did on the combined balance sheet and the Investment Bank of the Bear Stearns assets we brought on together with JPMorgan positions that were there to start with. And topped up the common equity that we allocate to the business from $22 billion to $26 billion, which is up a total of $5 billion versus the year-ago period. Moving on to slide 5, you can read it for yourself, it's number one working all the way down the page of all the capital raising categories that are here along with year-over-year increases in share. And as I said, that translates also into number one in global fees. So it's not just league table rankings, there's also fees as well along with being number three on an announced basis in M&A. Moving on to slide 6, I'll just talk you through some of the remaining significant risks we have in the Investment Bank. So remember, I'm talking leveraged lending now on slide 6. Remember that JPMorgan as of the last quarter end, 3/31 of '08, we had $22.5 billion of total lending commitments that we talked to you about. From here forward, I'm just going to break that down into what we call -- are now going to call legacy deals, think of those as $18.3 billion embedded in last quarter's end that were hung deals from last summer, off market terms against which we had to take marks, versus $4.2 billion at the time of the recent commitments done at market terms, which are moving in and out the door on a normal type of basis. So focused only on the $18.3 billion of leveraged loans, you see in the third bullet here that we started with 18.3, we added $1.9 billion related to Bear Stearns legacy commitments, we sold 19% of that combined exposure of $3.9 billion, to end the quarter with $16.3 billion of leverage -- legacy leveraged lending commitments. During the quarter, we took the $696 million of markdowns net of hedges, which brings us to cumulative markdowns of $3.3 billion or 20% of that $16.3 billion of commitments. Obviously, that's 20% average mark and each position is specifically marked where appropriate. Level three assets, no major change, slight uptick from 6% overall to 7% or so, which you'll see more when we file our Q. Moving on now to slide 7, Investment Bank mortgage related exposures, here, look at the second blue row. Total mortgage exposure at 3/31 for JPMorgan alone, looking across what we flagged for you before as the risky components of the mortgage space, $28.2 billion across prime, Alt-A, subprime and CMBS. When you pro forma that for what we acquired and brought on to the balance sheet together with Bear Stearns, at that time, it would have increased to $45.8 billion and then during the quarter from that peak level we brought it down by 28% or $12.8 billion to get down to the $33 billion we have across these categories at the end of the quarter. Obviously, down substantially, still a bit more than we want to have so we'll be continuing to actively reduce here. Mortgage-related markdowns, so against all this is where we took the $405 million of marks net of hedges and I'm not going to talk you through each bullet which gives you a little bit of texture on what's in each line, but just point out that much of what we own is AAA securities. We actively hedge across these categories where we think it actually makes sense. And of course see very little subprime when you look at the table. So that's it for slide 7. And last point on the Investment Bank, slide 8, let me just aside from the financial impact of Bear Stearns, got to say we're pleased with the progress we've made on integrating the business into ours. So on the people side, people selection done, 7,000 or so Bear Stearns employees have been identified to join the combined Investment Bank. On the infrastructure side, a tremendous amount of work done to get the May 30th closing done and integration there and as you can read for yourself, we've got a robust set of plans, business by business, unit by unit, to go all the way through to bringing it fully integrated infrastructure so it's a lot of work still to do. We know how to do all this stuff and that work is under way and think of that as business as usual execution for us from now and at the bottom of the page, a repeat of some of the details of the derisking that I talked about upfront. So with that I'll leave the Investment Bank and move on slide 9 to Retail Financial Services, where we'll look on page 9 at some of the stats that drive the overall performance of the business. So look at these and keep in mind that on the next page you're going to see 15% revenue growth in the Retail Financial Services businesses overall and this is what's driving it. So you see continued growth momentum across these stats. So starting with the Regional Bank, you see deposits of $214 billion, up 3% from a year ago. And checking accounts below that circle at 11.3 million, up 9% from a year ago. Along with that comes the continued growth in sales activity against the customer base, mortgage originations, investment sales, credit card sales, all up and all continued focus on investing in the growth of this business for the long term. The other side of it is tightened underwriting standards in the lending businesses driving Home Equity originations of $5.3 billion in the quarter, down 64% from a year ago. And then mortgage loan originations, $56.1 billion in the quarter, which is up from a year ago. Our share in the business is actually up from in the mid single digits to something like 14% or so overall which we're pleased with. And you'll see that much of that, more than 90% of that origination is conforming to government standards. So moving along through to the agencies. And lastly, 15% growth in the servicing book. Moving on to slide 10, you'll see how that translates into P&L. So total profit in the business, $606 million after tax for the quarter, which is down year-over-year despite the 15% revenue growth to $5 billion that you saw from the prior page. And the big driver here is credit. So you see circled the $1.3 billion of total credit costs in the Retail business, which includes higher charge-offs across all the major categories and I'm going to go through in a second. Along with additions to reserves, loan loss reserves of $430 million, primarily related to the subprime and prime mortgage portfolios and then additional to that we added $170 million in loan loss provision to get to a total of $600 million against the residential mortgage portfolios. That $170 million relates to prime loans we hold in the corporate investment portfolio booked in corporate, which you'll see in a second as well. Expenses, modest growth really reflecting the top line growth that you see. And then you can read for yourself where the profit growth really comes from with tremendous improvements and growth in the profits of the deposit-taking consumer and banking business, which is up to $674 million of profits. Let me now dive down for a second now into the credit picture for the Retail business, so on slide 11 -- you've seen all these pages before. I'm not going to walk through every piece of it here. Let me take you immediately to the upper right-hand corner here, key stats, where you see the total portfolio here at $95 billion in home equity. We had $511 million of net charge-offs, up from $447 million last quarter and obviously up very substantially from a year ago. Now, we talked about this as being a portfolio that versus the first quarter $450 million or so of charge-offs was potentially going to grow to $900 million of charge-offs by the fourth quarter of this year, is what we told you at our Investor Day. What I would say now is the $511 million is still going to deteriorate by maybe a couple hundred million dollars to get to a quarterly level that could be -- may be less than 900, could be around $700 million or so, but it's still too early to declare victory on that but the trend of deterioration may be slowing a bit here, but we'll wait and see. Moving on to subprime, though, on page 12, go to the same upper right box and you see the $14.8 billion portfolio, which by the way is in runoff at this stage. We've effectively eliminated all new production in this bucket. So that $14.8 billion deteriorating credit continues, so charge-offs of $192 million in the quarter, up from $150 million last quarter. Here I would say these numbers could increase to something to the tune of $350 million per quarter sometime in 2009 if we continue to see no improvement in some of the loss curves as we talked to you about before. Lastly on the prime side, slide 13, you see in total split between what sits in corporate and what sits in the Retail business, $47 billion of prime loans and charge-offs related to that of $104 million, split between those two categories, corporate and Retail, for 91 basis points of charge-offs. Obviously, very high and up dramatically from a year ago. And here again, the loss curves, unless they abate, we could see these quarterly losses growing to be as high as $300 million a quarter sometime in 2009 but likely to take a few quarters before we get there. Card. Moving along from Retail to card, on page 14. Pretty much as we expected in May. So you see that we had net income of $250 million, down year-over-year. The big driver here is credit costs. So you see a charge-off rate of 4.98% so just shy of 5% or right at 5% as we talked about, along with, we added $300 million to the allowance for loan losses in the credit costs line during the quarter. And so even though you see decent growth relative to the competitive field and average outstandings up 4% from a year ago and flattish from prior quarter, and charge volume growth of 7% in sales volume, despite that, you see a pretty weak revenue growth, just up 2% year-over-year, and as we talked about, we would have expected that to be a little stronger, given the weakening of the credit environment. But the somewhat good news is that the low level of early delinquency rates, the 30 day delinquencies, still at 3.46% or so, together with continued relatively strong payment rates in this environment is not giving us the revenue pickup we would usually expect to see in the business so we'll see whether that continues in the second half of the year or not. Moving on to the commercial bank, slide 15, great results here. You see for yourself, record profits of $355 million, up strongly from a year ago on record revenues of $1.1 billion which is up 10%, happening across all products. You see the balance sheet, 19% growth in loans and 18% growth in liability balances as the people in this business do a great job of capitalizing on a challenging environment for many of our competitors, taking market share. In particular on the revenue side, I just want to point out, remember we talked about at the time of the Bank One merger the opportunity here to grow annualized Investment Banking revenues delivered to this customer base from something like 4 or $500 million annualized to $1 billion was our goal. This quarter we set a record there and with $270 million per quarter of investment banking revenues have exceeded that target for the first time. Credit actually continues to be a well-behaved tier. Credit costs running -- charge-offs running 28 basis points below through the cycle average here and very strong allowance to loan coverage, 2.61% ratio there. Feel very good about that and a very modest change in non-performers in the course of the quarter. Also now moving on to Treasury & Securities Services, you see excellent results here as well, $425 million of profits, up 21% from a year ago. That's a record, as is the revenues of $2 billion, up 16% from a year ago in both the Treasury Services and worldwide security services segment. And liability balances, again, think deposits up 23% from a year ago and assets under custody to $15.5 trillion, up 2% from a year ago. A little bit of seasonal benefit in the dividend season in Europe, gives some revenue lift from the first quarter to the second, that will abate a bit as we go from second to third. And moving on lastly, across the businesses to Asset Management, here we had $395 million of profits, up from last quarter, down from a year ago. The decline from a year ago obviously driven by the lower market levels driving management fees down as well as year-over-year decrease in performance fees driving the changes in the institutional and Retail segments you see there. Private bank revenues up very strongly and we continue to do what we need to do to build -- continue to build what we think is a great business here. On corporate, slide 18, just break it down into three pieces as you're used to seeing two of them and Bear Stearns is new. So Private Equity had after tax profits of $99 million on pretax gains of $220 million, portfolio ended at $7.7 billion of carrying value. The Bear Stearns numbers of $540 million after tax negative, exactly what I talked to you about on the first page, so I won't bother talking about that, and then corporate, excluding both of those pieces, $19 million for the positive, you see in the bullets on the right, We hold in the investment portfolio originated by retail of $157 million to the negative after tax on both higher charge-offs and reserve additions there. Moving to slide 19, I'll just spend a second on the capital position so you see here in the middle of the page the Tier 1 capital ratio, very strong at 9.1%. I will tell you that we had talked about the relief that we got in our risk weighted assets for our intended liquidation and reduction of the Bear Stearns balance sheet over the next year or so is relief in the risk weighted assets number, without any of that relief, we would still have been at at an 8.1% Tier 1 ratio, which we we think is obviously excellent given that this is a quarter with challenging markets for reducing balance sheet and risk. We nonetheless absorbed the entirety of Bear Stearns and still maintained our target range of 8 to 8.5% Tier 1 even without the relief that we have here. The relief suggests that we intend to continue to reduce risk there as time goes by. You look down the page, all the ratios on whether it's on a with relief basis or without, extremely strong. I'll just point out at the top of the page, you see Tier 1 capital of $99 billion, up from $89 billion last quarter, if you recall we issued $6 billion of a straight DRD preferred stock issuance in the quarter and tangible common equity, obviously up without that, just due to growth in the retained earnings position of the company. So very strong capital position, but I will point out that in that Tier 1 capital, our mix of components of Tier 1 capital is more heavily weighted on average to common equity and your traditional trust preferreds, so like we did the straight DRD preferred in the first quarter, we have ample room to issue hybrid type of capital instruments to help us make sure we are in a position to meet organic balance sheet growth needs of our businesses and what obviously is a great time to have capital to deploy, yet still be confident that we're going to be able to maintain very strong capital ratios, if we choose to do so. And that is it for the current quarter. Let me just take you through slide 20 and just talk you through what I haven't already in terms of outlook. So in the Investment Bank in particular, obviously the markets look to remain challenging and volatile and stressed for the remainder of the year, and liquidity is not as strong as we would like to see it just yet. So it's a reasonable expectation to see continued lower levels of earnings than we would like to see over time in the Investment Bank for now. While we have strong loan loss reserves in the Investment Bank, and as I said, low level of current losses, credit is pretty idiosyncratic in this segment so a single name in the portfolio has problems and you could see a significant P&L event in any given quarter, and despite our satisfaction with what progress we made in balance sheet derisking during the quarter, as you saw from the pages I flagged, we still have substantial remaining risks to remain focused on. In Retail, the underlying growth we're going to continue to invest in growth so you can count on that. Also, as I said, continued deterioration in the residential mortgage credit factors and just a broader point that the weaker that housing gets, you're going to start to see more and more areas of potential deterioration. So pointing out two that could emerge somewhat in the future would be greater level of loan repurchases and also losses taken if mortgage insurers can't meet their obligations to the banking industry. Card Services, nothing different than what we said before, losses 5% or so in the second half of the year, plus a little bit and could average 6% in 2009 and continued pressure on the revenue side, both charge volumes and outstanding. Commercial bank continued underlying growth, same in Treasury Services. Asset Management, got to remain focused on market levels because that obviously affects both management and can have an effect on performance fees. Lastly in the corporate segment, Private Equity, expect that in these market conditions will trend lower than we have over time would be our best estimate so lower levels of realized gains than what we've seen for the first half of the year. Bear Stearns, as I said up front, $500 million of after tax merger costs remain to be booked, could run up to $150 million a quarter after tax in the third and fourth quarter and trend down from there and lastly, on corporate, I'll just remind you that we typically talk about a net loss after tax of in the range of 50 to $100 million. There's two exceptions to that. One is going to be on top of that we'll have the prime mortgage credit costs as that portfolio works itself through and remember that was $157 million after tax in this quarter. And then investment portfolio volatility, just changes in values as positions there can cause volatility in any given quarter. So with that, I wrap up the comments here, and Jamie and I will just take some questions.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hey, Glen, how you doing?
MIKE CAVANAGH: You know, we don't get -- I flagged some of the areas -- I'll take it in two pieces. A little bit of drag means that just for the month of June, the Bear Stearns ongoing activities contributed somewhat to the marks we took in leveraged loans and mortgages, as well as we basically have taken on expenses ahead of revenues, so a little bit of drag after tax related to that. So all that's saying is the $400 million of after tax profits in our Investment Bank could have been a couple hundred million higher had it not been for including the Bear Stearns results in the second quarter but as we said, those results are going to trend to the positive beginning in the second half of the year. They'll be incrementally positive. As we said, the areas of strength, as you would expect, very strong results in rates, currencies, emerging markets, credit trading so some areas really with standout performance.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I wouldn't even think of it that way.
JAMIE DIMON, PRESIDENT, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: No contribution, very -- almost no contribution FICC and Bear in the fourth -- this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, when you look at the growth numbers in Retail, their revenues are up 15% and almost all categories are growing, positive accounts, investments our mortgage share is up to 11%. While right now it isn't very profitable. I have good hopes that will be far more profitable down the road, That's opening branches, hiring salespeople and doing the things you always do. Some of the credit costs, you look at those at a sunk cost at this point. Card, spend is up 7%, but the way to look at it a little bit, we're gaining share in consumer and small business, albeit obviously sales themselves are down a little bit. So we're continuing to invest in marketing in that business like any other business. We're not going to stop doing that because you have credit losses.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Good morning, Guy.
JAMIE DIMON: I think, Guy, the way to look at it is very little. You know, there are some reserves to litigation and taxes and things like that, but those are best estimates and ordinary course now. They'll be changed over time if the expectations change and most of these severance and real estate and stuff like that related is actually costs. We know the cost at this point. And then all the things related to the balance sheet, derisking, deleveraging, conforming accounting, think of that as gone.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yeah. Those operating losses are already spent.
JAMIE DIMON: There's nothing else there.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Realized or just marked down.
MIKE CAVANAGH: At the rest of the company.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Absolutely not.
JAMIE DIMON: All right. So one of the things Mike mentioned is that number has come down a couple hundred million but the expected losses for subprime and prime is up by a couple hundred million so it's kind of a wash in our eyes. It's just if you look at the latest numbers of delinquencies and roll rates, people go from 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, looks like it might be a little bit lower than it was before. It is very early. We do not know. It's June. A lot of people could argue there's some seasonality in that. It's a little ray of sunshine which it's okay to grab onto for now.
JAMIE DIMON: That's absolutely correct.
JAMIE DIMON: There were no write-downs this quarter to monoline. Maybe some modest marks, something like that. I want to point out, we always showed the gross exposures. Some are hedged and some aren't hedged because we always acknowledged that there are risks on both sides of that. There is no real perfect hedge as you know. Some things like Alt-A really can't be hedged. The monolines, I think we told you in the past that for JPMorgan alone, unless there's an actual default, the risks are not high. We took on some additional risk from Bear Stearns. I would still make that statement, that the risks -- you're talking about, unless there's a major default of one of the major ones, that they're really not that high. There could be marks up or down a couple hundred million dollars. We're relying a little more than we're used to on the monolines for some of the things, because Bear Stearns had some, but it's really not a major thing for us. Put it this way, the worst case isn't that bad.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. So that ratio, obviously is high and I think it was a very healthy reserve relative to results. Ongoing should probably look a little bit more normal. This is just reflective of how we think we need to pay people, et cetera, but obviously was a fairly healthy addition this quarter. We don't want our people getting depressed, put it that way. We want to keep morale up.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Guy, we're working on that now. As you know, we're under the different regulatory regime for Basel II and examination in the investment banks and we're hoping to be the first major bank to be approved to go into parallel run potentially as early as the fourth quarter of this year.
JAMIE DIMON: Our Basel II number as we currently see it would be very strong and I think if we use the same rules and requirements that the Investment Banks use, it would be even stronger than that.
JAMIE DIMON: I challenge those numbers. I'm not sure that those investment banks are using true Basel II type numbers many we don't know the detail. Ours would be very strong. We've just got to wait until it sorts out. You saw recently the Feds and the SEC having an agreement to be sharing the stuff like that so there will be some commonality down the road on how people do Basel II. I would question whether those Basel II numbers are the same as ours.
JAMIE DIMON: No, just do your own analysis of the facts.
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hey, Mike.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, it's exactly the same risk factors and all the other things. It's high CLTV, high LTV, it's stated income, it's California, Florida, Arizona. I agree with you, they're staggering numbers. We have all the politicians telling people it's okay not to pay your mortgages. It's just really hard for us to tell. Our current expectations of those losses can triple from here. We're prepared for that and we will reserve for that appropriately going forward.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. We had $100 million a quarter and we could go to $300 million a quarter, next quarter. But if you look at current trends, maybe we're being overly conservative, that could be $300 million a quarter sometime in '09. For a while, not forever.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, we don't. We can't.
MIKE CAVANAGH: So our total OCI, deteriorated by about $1 billion in the quarter to be -- if that's the question, Mike.
JAMIE DIMON: Non-agency MBS where?
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. I think if you look at non-agency MBS, that is the number we're talking about at prime which is held both in Retail and in Corporate. That is non-agency whole loans, mostly jumbo whole loans.
JAMIE DIMON: Securities. Very little. Very little other securities which are non-agency. There's some, we buy and sell securities all the time. We bought some credit card BBB loans, we bought some CLOs. We have a huge portfolio we try to manage for total returns.
JAMIE DIMON: So Bear, we hope to see that it will be a positive contribution next quarter and build up to sometime in '09 to $250 million a quarter. The underlying results are outstanding. I mean the trading results, the investment banking results, really outstanding. You talk to clients, I think they would be very happy with us across the board. But you have to look at the environment today and just assume it's going to continue for a while. There's still assets we want to get down. There's lot of risk in holding syndicated loans and mortgages. The values are much better because they've been written down so much. Mike mentioned the average leveraged loan is now $0.80 to the dollar. In the environment like this we assume as we hedge stuff that we'll probably have to pay a little bit more going forward. Eventually that will end and you'll get the real underlying results. The only other thing in there, because we do have a lot of credit exposure which is very idiosyncratic. There could be great reserves but you have some big surprise in a credit loan somewhere, that could cost us, and we should be prepared for that, too.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the mark-to-market accounting makes it harder for a bank to buy a bank because you have to basically write the loans to a market value but it does not make it impossible. Certainly not for us. The right circumstances, we're sure we could raise the capital we need to do it but it does make it harder. This is a good environment, I'm speaking generically now, I would expect this will lead to more mergers over time. Nothing is impeding us. But it's not just up to us, as you pointed out.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. That's effective immediately, right.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I believe so.
JAMIE DIMON: It's effective immediately and it's effective from now going forward, unless it gets changed. We don't know if it will be changed or not. We wouldn't do a deal or not do a deal based on pure accounting deal. We would do or not do a deal based on how much value we thought it adds to shareholders. Just makes it harder, that's all.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it's not -- I wouldn't look at it like they're Bear Stearns assets anymore because these books are combined and run by a consolidated asset team at this point. But if you look at the assets that Mike spoke about, mortgages, leveraged finance and obviously some other categories we didn't spend time on. They'll be coming down over time.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, I would think of that as large liquidation of the large contributor, consuming the book value that we're talking about earlier.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Between write-downs and operating losses as we deleveraged.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, we applaud our friends at Wells Fargo but we don't have quite that much guts going forward. We're not going to increase dividend until we see clear daylight.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We took equity up in anticipation somewhat of all this by a billion in the first quarter from $21B to $22B. Remember also that our allocated equity is really just allocated common equity. So when you look at pure comparisons, you've got to add a share of the non-common equity component of the firm's capital to get to the real kind of denominator when you do some of the calculations that are often done. So we go through all that and I guess the one last thing to remember is that when we do our own internal compares of capitalization to get to sort of stand-alone single A type of ratings, you've got to parse through versus our competitors that hold asset management businesses, private equity businesses, et cetera, inside their overall units when doing a comparison of our Investment Banking units to those. You have some parsing to do to arrive at what real pure comparisons look like. On all that kind of basis, I think we get to a place that we feel like is appropriate and we continue to watch it and look beyond just the nominal levels and look at some risk weightings in our sense of where risk really sits and compare to economic calculations as well.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike mentioned our Tier 1 has a much higher component of common equity which you could say is high quality Tier 1. But across the board, we try to be conservative. I always talk about quality of capital which is maybe a peculiar concept. Loan loss reserves are very strong. We're massively over reserved by a couple billion dollars in our pension plans. We got out of the auto leasing business. Our card I/O is very strong. It's really across the board. You can look at all these things and call us conservative. We believe in maintaining a strong balance sheet on all counts, not just strong Tier 1 but all these other things I just mentioned.
JAMIE DIMON: You saw subprime go first and then on a slight lag, you saw home equity go, and now in a lag, you're seeing prime go. It's exactly the same loss factors. Remember, the components of where we are in the states and all stuff like that is very different and we started doing more jumbos in '07, so a lot of that is -- part of that is '07 vintage which I think I told you the time we're going to do and grow balance sheet and gain share and we were wrong. We obviously wish we hadn't done it. When you adjust for all of these things, vintages, CLTVs, stated income, where it's done, that's what we're seeing. It's very early in the loss curve, so the $300 million is just kind of rolling forward and projecting. We hope it doesn't go there but it easily could. It's where things could go, depending on a set of views internally.
JAMIE DIMON: Different locations, different vintages. I mean, we understand your point. We disagree. It's that prime looks terrible and we're sorry. We can say it eight times. It looks terrible.
JAMIE DIMON: Hi, Jeff.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know the number offhand, Mike.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No. I mean, the way I might explain it, Jeff, is we significantly ratcheted back our underwriting standards in prime to be fundamentally much more of a traditional underwriting standard, much less stated income, LTVs from here that are targeted to not be in excess of the expected home price in given areas. So we're in some parts of the country, max LTV currently at 65%, et cetera, et cetera. When you layer that through and look at our portfolio split between the balances that we would continue to underwrite on our given standards and those that we wouldn't, for what we would continue to underwrite, the existing credit performance is substantially lower than this overall level of 91 basis points of loss. So we feel confident that our current underwriting is wholly different than sort of the pig and the stick that we have working through of what has been already underwritten, with the risk factors that Jamie described. I think one of the drivers is home prices in some of the areas that we put on loans has come down so substantially that where we were in situations of relying on, or rather, because it was prime not relying on mortgage insurance and home values have dropped even below 80% original LTVs, we're taking losses. Those are some of the dynamics.
JAMIE DIMON: I should point out, what we see if home Equity goes where we're going it will be north of $300 million (corrected by company after the call) by a little bit and the prime will be $220, $230, $240 million. It may be temporary. It may hit that and come down real quickly.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It may be. It's all we have. We don't have a great compare point, because that's the preponderance of what we have in the portfolio.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Mostly have jumbos, so that's my point. I don't have a good compare point inside of the portfolio because that's the preponderance of what we have actually on balance sheet, conforming stuff obviously goes straight out the door to the agencies and doesn't stay on balance sheet.
JAMIE DIMON: I think jumbo is more proportionately California too so that probably has a lot to do with that.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I'd say it's two pieces. We've been cautious related to commercial real estate as we talked about in the Commercial Bank. But when you look at some small portion of the portfolio related to home builders, you saw in the first quarter really the more significant additions to reserves in the quarter and that's really, you know, as time goes by in certain portions of the portfolio go under stress, they get downgraded and require incremental reserves. In aggregate, we feel confident about where we're putting on growth from here but it's just the dynamics of degradation in certain sectors, particularly anything related to home builders.
JAMIE DIMON: By the way, the portfolio, and thanks for pointing it out, is very strong. I would think you should expect non-performers to go up. We have never seen environments like this where it doesn't happen even in a strong portfolio, and all of the growth, we really are comfortable. We see enormous opportunities to grow it and feel kind of like Wells Fargo felt about it. There's a lot of clients. They need loans. They want to grow. A lot of municipalities. A lot of the growth is coming from government and not-for-profit which is generally pretty secure. It almost has to deteriorate in an environment like this.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks for pointing out that our deposits in assets under management, up 25%, TSS up 15% (corrected by company after the call) and Commercial Bank up 19% which shows you kind of the power of this franchise over time, and we worry about us. I think there are going to be issues. I think you heard a lot of regulators talk about some of the issues with banks out there which may have more problems in their commercial real estate and that will cause obviously some deposits to be concerned about it. But we think we'll be a beneficiary of all that.
JAMIE DIMON: You know, it's different all over the place, the competition for deposits right now. We're not really chasing it. You're not seeing growth in our deposits because we're chasing them. I think some of the people have really raised rates because they need them.
JAMIE DIMON: Honestly, we don't know the answer to that question.
JAMIE DIMON: Hey, John.
JAMIE DIMON: Yeah, so first of all, we don't think the change in accounting -- remember, we're talking about 2009, 2010, will be consequential at all. It could put hundreds of billions of dollars back on the balance sheet. It's really not clear. We may show you a lot more of this next time because it's come up many times but we analyze it, we don't think it's that big of a deal for us. We understand the regulators' points. It is putting too much fear in people's eyes that is a little bit unjustified. We already got rid of double cycle billing and we already got rid of us default pricing. Or off-us repricing at all. The new changes coming up could have an impact. It could be material. A lot of it will with one shot, just one time, it will hurt you for a year or something like that and -- but it really remains to be seen how it gets implemented and really how competitors react. You change prices, all the competitors react and do something about it in the first place. The interchange thing could also be dramatic though I would be surprised if you have pricing controls like that in the United States of America.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That would be our hope, John. Potentially some response on our part to what we're seeing could be a factor in the second half of the year.
JAMIE DIMON: It would be $50 billion of risk weighted assets.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Correct. So clearly, Ron, just remember, that is the accounting effect that we would agree that it's probably likely that credit card QSPEs come on so that's $70 billion and maybe something less than $50 billion RWA come on, which obviously will eat into Tier 1 capital ratio but the regulators get to take their view themselves and not necessarily accounting on how they'll handle all that. We don't know enough yet how that's all going to play out. If that were the outcome, we could handle it, obviously.
JAMIE DIMON: We're retaining a lot of capital. We retain capital even at these low earning numbers. We kind of expect that to continue. We're retaining capital. You're talking about '09, 2010, 2011, so we'd be in very good shape with that.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's too early to tell.
JAMIE DIMON: If you go through what I would consider the worst case, it's still not that big a deal. It hurts your Tier 1 ratios by 50 basis points and other basis points. Who cares. At one point it's another number on a piece of paper and we've got plenty of ways to raise capital or add preferred stock or reduce asset growth or something like that, or recalibrate our capital targets. Nothing fundamentally is changing as accounting changes, right?
MIKE CAVANAGH: The conduit can go on the balance sheet but that would barely impact capital because already included in capital On a risk weighted basis, there's a couple hundred billion of other forms of securitizations totaling up that we can take you through at a future time. There's plenty of business actions that we would see taking to make adjustments to likely make any impact from any of that very manageable. Some of that would be rationally. We've got absolutely no risk. It wouldn't matter. Remember, we have a very, very forward-looking view of capital. So we already project our capital throughout '09 and we already know that we can handle all that stuff easily. Might change what we do elsewhere. We already know we can handle that easily.
JAMIE DIMON: That was over 100%. They were going into negative equity. I think the number -- that was a forecast, right.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think it was 10% in negative equity at the beginning. Going to potentially 20%. So we're somewhere along that spectrum of 10% going to 20% in negative Equity. We can confirm that for you.
JAMIE DIMON: We can't really project how people will act who go negative equity who have been living in the home for three or four years. Because you're getting different vintages now. The kids have been there, the kids are going to school. It's a different thing than maybe people bought their homes on 100% LTV in 2006, 2007. That's possibly why you're seeing some improvement there.
JAMIE DIMON: We're assuming they won't act well.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's possible they aren't as bad as we might expect.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Okay. I think that's it. Thank you everybody for joining us. Look forward to next quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Take care. Thank you.",0.09999999999999998,0.24400000000000016,1,0.07962207205802885,0.09902179604583454
25,Q1_2016,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35, and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue. And despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good, and pretty straightforward. Consumers remain on solid footing, leading to robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance. In Consumer we saw double digit growth in deposits year on year, healthy loan growth across products driving 17% core loan growth for the Firm, and high single digit card sales volumes. The wholesale businesses performed in line, or better than expectations expressed at Investor Day, and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets with significant volatility and global macro uncertainty. The Firm's results included one significant item, [$713] million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to oil & gas reserves and $162 million in metals and mining reserves, which were generally in line with [our guidance]. But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors totaling $48 million, (technical difficulties) guidance of up to $4.75 billion of charge-offs this year. While oil prices have improved somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong. Further natural gas, which is a meaningful portion of our portfolio, does remain depressed. We don't feel that current prices are sufficient to [spare] a meaningful restart of production. And many of the cost reductions and conservation actions that have been taken are not easily and quickly reversed. Therefore, the impact of oil prices is somewhat asymmetric on credit costs. Reserves are main specific. They're based on downgrades reflecting the actual financial condition and the [crediting] position of borrowers. As such, we likely will see some incremental reserve builds for the rest of the year, but they will be increasingly situation specific and our ability to estimate them will improve over time. However using reasonable stress assumptions, on draws, downgrades and considering spin-over effects to closely related companies, those incremental reserves could reach $500 million, plus or minus, this year but with a very high degree of variability around that number. We continue to believe overall our client base is relatively well positioned to weather this downturn. And we will be there to support them whenever feasible. We also monitor for contagion. And aside from experiencing a couple of main specific issues in very closely related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad based and would not expect losses to be significant. Moving on to page 2. Pausing on this page for just a moment, a few comments from overall revenue and expense. We told you that the first rate hike, together with our strong loan growth, would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion. And the $700 million increase in net interest income year over year that you see here is in line with that. However sequentially NII was only up slightly as expected, given the absence of certain securities gains that we had in the fourth quarter, as well as day count. Non-interest revenue was down $1.5 billion year on year, primarily driven by the market environment in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as Asset Management, with the biggest drivers being lower IBCs and fixed income markets revenue. In both case versus a very strong prior year. Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year on year on lower performance-based compensation while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth. Turning to page 3. The Firm's fully phased-in advanced fee ET1 ratio was 11.7%, with standardized at 11.9%. The improvement to both ratios was driven primarily by net capital generation. Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory, and as expected we did see that reverse with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter on quarter reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secure financing activity. This also drove a slight increase in RWA, net of run-off and model calibration. Firm SLR improved to 6.6%. And we returned $3 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1.3 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share. Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan, giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter. Moving onto page 4 and Consumer and Community Banking. You'll notice that we consolidated Consumer into one page, and for your reference we've included the old pages in the appendix. CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strength across all lines of business. And TNS just announced that for the fourth consecutive year we are the Number One consumer retail bank, reflecting our ability to attract, satisfy and retain customers. The fundamental business drivers remain strong, with average loans up 12% year on year and core loans up 25% driven by mortgage and auto but with strength across products. And we saw record deposit growth of $50 billion, up 10%. We added over one million households since last year. And our active mobile customer base was up 19%. Revenue of $11.1 billion was up 4% year on year, and up 1% sequentially if you exclude from last quarter nearly $200 million from the Square IPO and a branch sale. In Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 4% year on year reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned, as well as higher account and transaction volumes, and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment. Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card Commerce Solutions and Auto revenue was up [2%] on strong auto loan and lease growth, 8% growth in card sales and 12% in merchant processing volumes, all of which more than offset the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 2% year on year with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continued to make progress against our commitments, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth. Finally, credit trends in the Consumer businesses continue to be favorable. Now turning to page 5 and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.1 billion and an ROE of 11%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year on year driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market which was down 27%. We continue to rank
MARIANNE LAKE: So the first thing I'd say is with respect to oil and gas, obviously I think $529 million is pretty close to $500 million, plus or minus. So that was pretty much in line. But you are saying it'll be a little bit higher with metals and mining. We were expecting close to $100 million and there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter, and that kind of timing is going to happen. It doesn't change the overall sort of perspective for us. With respect to draws, when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve build, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws. And clearly we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that that may not be necessary, and in other cases we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases. But we will expect to see draws and that's contemplated in our guidance. And I want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete. So this is not just oil and gas and metals and mining, as the [Mace] Code would suggest. We've looked at very closely related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. So we're trying to be very complete.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: We've yet to take a loss.
MARIANNE LAKE: We have taken a couple. Not very much.
MARIANNE LAKE: So of the $1.2 billion, $1 billion was a combination of oil and gas and metal and mining, so the vast majority and outside of that, consistent with my comments on contagion, there's not any sort of thematic other noteworthy thing to mention to you. And obviously as we continue to watch the cycle play out over the next several quarters and reevaluate some clients that may be experiencing stress, it's likely that we will see some more MPLs. But I gave you context around what we're expecting to see in terms of reserve. So they will go up, but not to numbers I would consider to be large in the context of our wholesale portfolio.
MARIANNE LAKE: The draws are about $1.3 billion in the quarter. So some but not excessive. And after the reserves that we put up in the first quarter the coverage ratio is 6.3%.
JAMIE DIMON: What is it on balance and stuff?
MARIANNE LAKE: That is the on balance sheet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry Glenn, just on that 6.3%, that's the Firm. If you look in the Commercial Bank, obviously it's higher. So you've got a sort of a different portfolio mix in the Commercial Bank versus the CIB. So if it's some parts of our portfolio it's closer to 9% or 10% and in other parts it's lower. Sorry. Your second question?
MARIANNE LAKE: It's a perfectly reasonable question. And obviously when we look at growth in CRE, or the commercial real estate business, of 18% it's an obvious question, are you doing something different? And the answer is, no we're not. We haven't changed our geographies, we haven't changed our risk appetite. It just simply is the case that we have a good process and we are continuing to focus on our sort of core capabilities and our core risk segments. But we've been able to take advantage of the opportunity because our process is better, and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless to a degree, given that the CMBS market has been somewhat disrupted.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Betsy obviously, with having only received the specific feedback less than 24 hours ago we still have to get into the analysis phase about what it all means. I would start with your opening comment that considering our liquidity you were surprised. This doesn't appear to be a statement about the adequacy obviously of JPMorgan's liquidity, which is very significant, as you know. But it really about how we analyze and think about that at the material legal entity level and the inter-affiliate nature of how we formed our entity. So I can't tell you with any clarity exactly what will be required as we get into the analysis. It wouldn't be my core expectation that it would require us to do a meaningful overall new liquidity actions, but we have to do the work.
MARIANNE LAKE: Again, just based on our preliminary read, I think there's going to be significant work to meet the expectation of the regulators. And our plan already had us doing a lot of work around actual real simplification of legal entities and other things. So I don't know that there are going to be significant changes. It's not my primary expectation that there would be, but we do need to have a moment to go through the details.
JAMIE DIMON: The liquidity of the Company is extraordinary. We have $400 billion in central banks around the world, $300 billion of AA-plus short duration securities, just about $300 billion of very short-term secure -- really top quality repo or type of stuff like that. The trading book is $300 billion, which is mostly very liquid kind of stuff. So the liquidity of the Company is extraordinary.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say, just again, we need to do the work and we need to figure out obviously what the response to that will be. But it is encouraging that sometimes we're found to be credible for large systemic financial institutions. And if they have been able to adequately show their preparedness, we're confident we should be able to do the same. We just need to make sure that we understand the details of what it is that we don't have in our plan today that we need to change, and we're committed to doing it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, absolutely. So I just wanted -- if you used the industry codes the way that you could if you want to expand your thinking to just what is technically considered to be an oil and gas company, you'd miss out on, for example, a marine shipping company that all they do is ship oil and therefore their financial and their performance is going to be directly related to the health of the energy sector. Those companies we have identified them specifically, they are managed within our energy risk team. They are not managed by a different team. So I was simply saying that some of the companies that we are watching, and in one or two small cases that have experienced some stress, are not traditional energy companies. But their condition is directly related to oil and gas.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously not for us. I would say that it's competitive, as the C&I space is very competitive. Commercial real estate is also competitive, but it's not irrational. And we aren't seeing, or at least we are not seeing very rational proposals on structure and risk. Meanwhile we haven't changed our risk appetite, we haven't changed our underwriting standards. We continue to have lower LTVs and higher debt coverage ratios, pretty consistent geography. So speaking for JPMorgan specifically, there's been no change in our underwriting standards. In fact if anything since the last crisis, obviously the last recession, we tightened our underwriting standards and we've moved away from some of the riskier types of that business, so home builders and a lot of construction loan business.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hey, Mike. I'll start and then Jamie can add to it. So on the interest rate point, the colors are pretty consistent with what we said over time, which is we have the belief that the US economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing, and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the market, global growth will continue albeit at a moderate pace. And obviously stability in the markets in March has continued to help us with that thesis. So that coupled with the fact that the Fed themselves, while they are dovish in their narratives in the minutes and also they are [dots] are continuing to talk about gradual increases, and the debate around negative rates has kind of quieted. So we don't particularly run the Company with a day-to-day view on what's going to happen with interest rates, we are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been. But we also understand what the performance of the Company looks like if there are no more rate rises, or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways. So we are positioned for rising rates, it is our central case that will happen. The market is pricing less than one hike in this year. The Fed dot says two. Our research says two. We're just going to have to wait and see. I'll also start and then Jamie can jump in on the living will thing. We have to take it at face value in discussions with our regulators that we need to meet their requirements, whatever they may be, all of the rules whether it's capital, whether it's liquidity, whether it's stress testing, whether it's resolution plans. And if we do that and satisfy them, then we can continue to operate the Company the way that we think it is best for our clients and communities around the world. So at this point we need to remediate and address the issues and the feedback they've given us and resubmit a plan for assessment that we hope will be credible. And that's certainly what we will commit to do. And that's what we are focused on.
JAMIE DIMON: Well I don't think it's inconsistent. We're trying to meet all the regulations, all the rules and all the requirements. We've been doing that now for five or six years. What is it, six years since Dodd-Frank was passed. They had their job to do and we have to conform to it.
MARIANNE LAKE: I know it's easy to sort of overlook the quite a few statements where there's an acknowledgment that progress has been made. And none of the feedback in the letter negates the significant progress across the industry on capital liquidity stress testing. So it is consistent, but we have more work to do and we'll do it.
JAMIE DIMON: On the interest rate stuff, I wasn't predicting it. I'm simply saying I think there's a chance it will be different than what people expect, and it will be a little -- I said it'll gradual until it's sudden.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously we're the first to read out, and it's very difficult when you think about performance because you also have to think about the relative performance in the comparable periods and prior years and the like. So I would say that down mid-single digits adjusted for what we would consider to have been outperformance last year is really quite good performance. So I don't know that we gained share, but I certainly think we protected share, and it may differ across the different product sets. But I think in general we feel pretty good about our performance and we don't know anything to the contrary.
JAMIE DIMON: I'd just add that $5 billion-plus of sales and trading in a quarter like this look as good, earning decent returns. We have good margins. We're not quite sure about share, but it was -- I would look as quite a good performance. And trading losses, while we, was it six days you said to me?
MARIANNE LAKE: Six days, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Six days, there was -- like $40,000. So that the actual results were just -- that's really good. I look at that as a very healthy business.
MARIANNE LAKE: And then with respect to the restructuring and whether that presents opportunities for us broadly [define], including in compensation for -- we pay for performance and we pay risk (inaudible) returns, and we're not looking to try and make changes to what we've been very consistent about over time. And you can see our comp-to-revenue ratio of 32% this quarter is in line with the ratio in the first quarter of last year, and in fact the first quarter of the year before. So lower -- obviously on lower revenues, but a fair pay for the performance. And obviously we intend to insure that we are competitive, but we're not going to take any direct actions as a result of
MARIANNE LAKE: On legal, the number is [circ] $0. Pretax is actually slightly positive. After-tax we did some true-ups, assessments on penalty. So actually net/net about $0 this quarter, which I'll take it for the quarter but it doesn't necessarily predict the future. In terms of expenses, so we talked at Investor Day, Gordon in particular but also Daniel, that we are continuing to invest in our businesses. And across the board in fact adding bankers and technology and digital, digitizing, et cetera. So we continue to do that across the businesses and I mentioned in the CCB page that the net expenses, albeit down, includes self-funding $200 million of incremental investments year over year and growth. But you did notice the headcount in the Consumer businesses is up slightly. And that's a combination of the investments we're making in technology and digital, that's about 500 of the heads and other 1500 is increasing part-time staffing in the branches so that we have flexibility to make sure that we have loading at the right times of day for making sure the customer experience is good. So I would characterize it all as very consistent and yes, we continue to invest. And that is in part what you're seeing in the headcount in CCB.
JAMIE DIMON: And you saw new credit card Freedom Unlimited 1.5% back. We're doing a lot of stuff in Chase Pay. So the Starbucks thing, we apply the top digital side, and we continue to win awards in the Consumer Bank. So we'll always be investing there.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it is our expectation across both the consumer and the wholesale businesses outside of energy that the credit trends will remain favorable, or credit will be relatively benign. We're not expecting to see material increases, except for the fact that we are growing our loan portfolio. So when we did Investor Day we talked about charge-offs this year will go up year on year, and they will go up to potentially as high as $4.75 billion. But half of that would be on the back of the fact that we are growing our portfolios. So you'd just have natural sort of BAU levels of charge-off from that and then the other half would be on energy. So we're not expecting or seeing at this point anything, other than good credit quality for the rest of 2016, outside of the obvious.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I will start by saying that as you know our regulators have extraordinary powers over a wide range of requirements for us regardless, and many ways of influencing those and you're familiar with most of them. It is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if remediation is not satisfactory with, or cured within a two-year period, there are - there's a possibility that the regulators could jointly decide, may jointly decide, to take other actions that could include capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussions. So obviously they do have those powers. October is not that far away. We're going to do our very, very best to make sure that we put our best foot forward and remediate the issues and then we have another submission in July 2017. So not to suggest that we won't fully remediate them to the very best of our ability, but the living will process I expect to continue to be somewhat iterative over the next several cycles, and we continue to push ourselves to raise the bar. And I'm certain that the bar will continue to be raised on us, as it should.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Matt.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So we talked about the fact that if there's no change in rates and if we continue to grow our loans, we would expect our NII to go up by $2 billion. So you're right, if you look at the run rate right now that would be relatively flat from here. I think in our favor, because of the easing that's still going on around the rest of the world and the sort of the dovish Fed comments, there's been a lower re-price just in the industry generally. So that's in our favor and we're much more sensitive to the front end of rates. So we're not suggesting that the long end of the curve has no impact, it's relatively modest. So $2 billion, maybe a little more. The biggest driver of significantly higher NII above that guidance would be if we had another hike earlier than December.
MARIANNE LAKE: So not going to talk specifically about the Treasuries' actions, other than saying that we would support Fed tax reform in general. With respect to the impact on our business, either historically or going forward, it wouldn't be zero and it wouldn't be significant.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So obviously I'm not going to be able to talk specifically about our plans that we've submitted because we just submitted them and we haven't had any feedback and they are confidential, but I will tell you that obviously negative rates, it was the first time this has been in the scenario. It's not the first time we have thought about it, and it is not the first time that we've experienced it, and at least in other parts of the world in Europe, Japan and elsewhere. So we have had strategic discussions, we understand broadly what we think we would do and what would happen to our balance sheet. We can model it and we can effect it. So in that sense, now I mean obviously, we'll continue to work that process through if it continues to be a feature of CCAR. You're absolutely right that year over year our launch point is a higher level of capital and our balance sheet and our credit quality continues to improve, and our risk levels have not materially changed. So as a general matter we would hope, and we've also added [press]. So as a general matter we would hope to have incremental capacity but nothing inconsistent with what we have said externally, which is that the Board would like over time to continue to have the capacity to potentially increase dividends and that we would likely the capacity to, within a reasonable range, repurchase our stock. And that's the framework that we have used to submit our plan.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So if I do the -- I don't want to use the word call, if I adjust for the full impact of the asset sale that was in the quarter not just the $150 million in this quarter but also the revenues that were present with respect to that in the first quarter of last year, my adjusted revenues are down about 4% to a market that on average, while I appreciate that it recovered in March, but the market on average for the quarter was down around 5%. So we would characterize that as generally in line. And similarly if you do adjustments on the balance sheet side, the Assets Under Management and client assets. So certainly you can speak to Jason afterwards and reconcile our numbers so that we're not confusing each other. I'm sorry what was the second part of your question?
MARIANNE LAKE: Retail engagement. So retail engagement picked up in March, as you would expect. We saw positive flows. We obviously saw negative flows for the quarter in equities, that's not surprising. And then we saw positive flows, particularly in multi-asset. So we did see some reasonably healthier retail flows in the quarter, but primarily in March, and some were offset by outflows in equities.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: As luck would have it, in this quarter there is nothing one-time that you need to adjust for. Last quarter there obviously was. So we would expect that our NIM should be stable to improving over the course of 2016. The extent to which it would improve, obviously depending upon what happens in term of gradual rising rates.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So with respect to equity capital raises, I mean obviously to a degree that would be true, although those companies that were able to access the equity markets are not those that are experiencing the most stress. So obviously all other things equal it's a positive, but I'm not necessarily thinking it's going to take significant steam or the pressure off. With respect to second part of your question I'm so sorry?
JAMIE DIMON: The C&C.
MARIANNE LAKE: Jason will get back to you. I'm sorry, I don't have the answer.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So no, nothing has changed in the card competitive landscape, including in co-brands. It's still very competitive, albeit that we saw a little bit of deceleration in sales growth year over year last year and we've seen that trend back positively for us this year. So we feel good about that and we've been increasing our marketing spend and as Jamie did say, we launched Freedom Unlimited quite recently and it has been quite recent, but early feedback is very positive. With respect to Freedom with a 50% increases in activity and interest, there's going to be a degree of cannibalization of other products, we would expect that. But so far, so good. And we just like to give our customers choices. And its been favorably received.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the Manheim is down slightly. We continue to believe and expect that it will continue to trend downwards and so [also seeing] it will continue to trend upwards, just given where it is today and also the amount of leased inventory that will ultimately go into the used car space over the course of the next several years. However the fundamentals are still good, the market is still solid. We have pulled back on subprime a while ago. It's a small part of our originations. So other than seeing some delinquencies tick up, as expected, in some of the energy-related states but not very significantly, there's nothing at the moment that's on the burner.
JAMIE DIMON: For us. I do think you'll see issues in the market.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the MSR P&L for the quarter was a positive $124 million, and they are a combination of BAU and material factors that added up to that, and probably about half of it was a combination of hedge performance and the market.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, yes. So purchase applications are up 30%, I think, year on year. We continue to be positive momentum in that space, and we are seeing Spring activity continue to be robust, as expected.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So in terms of run rated, the two biggest drivers of the walk that we gave at Investor Day were the card co-brand renegotiations and the mortgage banking non-interest revenue. I would just point out that while we are seeing some of the incremental impact of card renegotiation, that will play out over the course of the year. But on the positive side -- and on the positive side mortgage banking, just given where rates were over the quarter, has been positive relative to central expectations when we did Investor Day. So those two things are worth noting. But we are seeing really quite good drivers in non-interest revenue drivers across the consumer space generally, in debit investments, in fees and accounts, in the sort of 4%, 5% range, and sometimes in the range higher than that. So we are continuing to see exactly what we expected, which is the majority of our businesses will continue to deliver mid- to high single digit growth, and they seem set to do that. The card impact will be what it will be, and mortgage NII will end up down year over year, whether it's $700 million or $600 million we'll see. And so the biggest driver of what the end result will be is going to be markets.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Look, the business is not immune to markets either. So obviously as you look at the performance for the quarter our fees have been impacted by low asset levels. And we also have got the tail impact of some business simplification, just getting the tail of that out of the performance. We are also seeing the benefit of higher rates. So I'd characterize the majority of those negatives on lower fees and simplification as being behind us. So the trajectory, if rates continue to rise, would be upwards. But that's why we said market dependence. We were not expecting our performance to go down from here. Flat to up, but depending on rates.
MARIANNE LAKE: So -JAMIE DIMON: I'd just use 32%.
MARIANNE LAKE: We've given a range 30% to 35%. We've been at the lower end of that range. When we performed very strongly we could drift up. If we perform less strongly, we pay for performance and I think we did a good job in the first quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: We have among the lowest ratio.
JAMIE DIMON: We're paying our people properly and well.
MARIANNE LAKE: And consistently.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's very fair. And we've talked about it pretty often, that people when they restructure, they restructure out of the things that they were less strong at, less comfortable at, and in many cases they double down where they continue to have strength. And we are seeing that. And that's what we mean when we say there's always someone left to fiercely compete in every part of our business, and equities is no exception. It's not the poster child for that. However, the equities business here at JPMorgan, we've rebuilt our technology platform. We have rebuilt the prime -- we've built the prime brokerage, international capabilities. The two of those work hand in glove. And we have every opportunity to continue to gain share and win.
JAMIE DIMON: And we've done very well gaining share in electronic trading and the prime broker has been built in Asia and Europe where we had weaknesses. So you've seen our share go up and we intend to win it. We have topnotch research, which obviously helps drive the equity business too.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: Give or take, and that's right. Obvious are there's a high degree of variability around it. If we had complete ability to understand it we would lean into those reserves. But it's name specific and situation specific, it would evolve over time. We just wanted to give you an indication that there's likely to be some more costs. It could be plus or minus quite a bit from that because we've had to make stress assumptions in there. But $500 million for nine months, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. No Gerard, I'm not going to make any comments about SNC, except to say that everything that we know and aware of is reflected in our results.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct. Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: They changed by a couple of billion dollars on a single name that we like, up.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks very much.
JAMIE DIMON: Wait. Before you all go. We should say goodbye to Sarah Youngwood who goes on to a bigger and brighter job as CFO of the Consumer Bank, and she did an outstanding job. And she's succeeded by Jason, who's going to say hi right now.
JAMIE DIMON: So congratulations. You guys have done an outstanding job.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, everyone. I nearly forgot.",0.09000000000000008,0.09200000000000014,1,0.10466501776001777,0.13107085215914396
26,Q2_2009,"
MIKE CAVANAGH, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Good morning, everybody. It's Mike. So we'll get started now and just if you could all refer to the presentation that's on our website, the slides we'll go through, so starting with a quick recap, I won't be redundant with what I'll say later but a quick recap of some of the big points in the quarter on Slide 1. So as you know we had net income of $2.7 billion in the quarter and that's earnings per share of $0.28. The EPS number is after the $1.1 billion, $0.27, TARP preferred repayment as well as the FDIC special assessment which was $0.10. That piece being booked in our Corporate segment. Normal and higher FDIC operating expenses you'll see referred to throughout the businesses but that's the regular cost, this $0.10 item is the second quarter special assessment, again booked in Corporate. So behind the results were record revenues, $28 billion for the quarter. That was a record for the quarter and also amounted to a record for the first half of the year. As well, pretax pre-provision profits, $14.4 billion for the quarter and were a record for a quarter and a record for the year, so that's on the back. Obviously you have some very strong results in our Investment Bank which we'll cover in a few minutes but also just broadly strong results in many of our businesses obviously with others Consumer Lending in particular faced with some challenges but I'll skip over that until we get to the business slides. But commenting for a second on capital, obviously the very strong capital ratio is much better than what we talked about what we're giving you sort of a no worse than numbers earlier in the quarter when we finished the stress test, but ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 capital and that's 9.7% Tier 1 ratio and a 7.7% Tier 1 common ratio. Also, in terms of balance sheet strength, we now have $30 billion worth of loan loss reserves, that's a coverage ratio of loans of about 5%. We'll obviously talk a lot about credit on the call later on but we feel very good about the overall reserving level. We've brought these levels up a lot in anticipation of deterioration and well aware of some of the trends you see in non-performers and so forth but all fully contemplated in the way we think about that $30 billion reserve number for what we have ahead of us. Also obviously repaid $25 billion in TARP capital in the quarter. Lastly, before we get into the businesses, it's just important to also point out that we're doing everything we think we should be doing to help the country get back on the road to recovery here, so we've done a lot in the trial modification space and foreclosure moratorium space both helping advise on what best practices are there and getting under way with it in a big way ourself, so we've got 138,000 trial modifications approved in the second quarter representing about $3.5 billion worth of mortgages and we'll see how those perform over time. That brings a total of foreclosures avoided to about 600,000 and obviously subject to safety and soundness. We continue to be an active lender on the back of the very strong capital we have so that's $150 billion of new credit extended in the quarter across-the-board, consumers, corporations, non-profit, municipalities and small businesses. So now if we just skip past Slide 2 which just gives you the numbers that I just referred to, let's go straight to the Investment Bank on Slide 3, so you see the Investment Bank had profits of $1.5 billion on revenues of $7.3 billion and I'll just pause here for a minute and just point out the first point here; Investment Banking fee revenue, $2.2 billion. That's a record for us in a quarter and a record for anybody at any firm in any quarter in terms of Investment Banking fee levels so we are very proud of those results. It's inclusive of very strong and record equity underwriting volumes and fees of $1.1 billion and I'll just ask you to flip to it now but the next slide just shows you the number one year-to-date rankings and essentially all of the major underwriting categories on a year-to-date basis globally so that continues to be the case and I'm very proud of it and obviously the #1 rank year-to-date on fees and #3 ranking in Global Announced M&A on the year-to-date basis. So very very proud of the client franchise and the corporate finance business and the Investment Bank. When you move then to the markets businesses I'll just make a general statement that across-the-board we saw the benefit of strong level of decline activity and continued wider spreads as a general matter. You did also see in the Equity Markets and Fixed Inccome Markets businesses the negative impact of our spread tightening on the valuation of some structured notes in each of those businesses but now just looking at each business separately, Fixed Income Markets, up $4.9 billion and that is strength across-the-board, rates, FX, commodities, emerging markets. so forth, all performing well and I'll show you a slide that gives you the remaining positions in leveraged loans and risky mortgage assets that we've been talking about for many, many quarters now but the net effect on those were modestly positive, P&L marks on those positions in the quarter, so we're going to comment on that in another second. Equity Markets $700 million of revenues and again, strong client results especially in prime services, but weaker on the trading side, the positioning side in the business. Moving then down to I'll go right to credit costs, so credit costs we had $871 million of credit costs and that's charge-offs of $433 million, 2.55% charge off rate in the quarter, up a bit from last quarter and then the allowance we added $438 million bringing the total allowance to almost 8%, 7.91% to loans in the Investment Bank. Obviously, we did have the negative trends in the charge-off rate but it's been, we reserve as we downgrade things so we think that 8% level of reserves is totally appropriate despite the movement higher in some of the non-performers there. And so with that let me move on from the P&L for the Investment Bank to past delete tables which we talked about to Slide 5, which is the key risk exposures in the Investment Bank. So here, we've collapsed on to one page the details around what we've talked about for many, many quarters now of what we called our key risk exposures in these two spaces. I'm just going to recap where we are now since in the future we'll probably stop talking about this as a generic matter and only bring it up when there's something relevant to or noteworthy to bring to your attention. So first on leverage lending if you'll recall we started with $43 billion on a pro forma basis with Bear Stearns back in September 2007 and that's on a notional basis. Now, we carry a remaining amount of market value of $3.3 billion and that's carried at roughly $0.42 on the dollar so those are marked down values for what remains. Obviously exposure came down nicely in the quarter and the P&L as I said earlier was modestly positive net of hedges on this remaining amount, so obviously much smaller exposure and unlikely to be a noteworthy topic of conversation in the future but before closing that out I wanted to point out where we stood. Next, mortgage related, this going back to its peak was $48 billion in December 2007. Here, we have about $12.6 billion remaining flattish quarter-over-quarter. In this quarter, we are modestly positive again across-the-board here and so what I would say about this is about half of it really, a little less than half relates to normal ongoing client business inventory levels and the other half is positions, legacy positions that we like where all of this stuff is marked and we'll just take the step that is legacy and slowly liquidate it out over time. So again, we'll talk about it in the future where it creates relevant P&L conversation but at the level of marks we have now in a quarter where it's been very quiet for us that's where we stand on those two areas of exposure, dramatically down from where we started and so moving forward into business as usual there. Moving on to Slide 6, Retail Financial Services. I'll just quickly hit some of the drivers of the results in this business. Remember, we talked about this in two buckets, the Retail Banking or branch side and the Consumer Lending which includes all of the mortgage lending activity and servicing activity and mortgage portfolio we hold, auto, student loans and so forth. So on the top Retail Banking, feel very good about the underlying growth dynamics again in our business. We've got deposits of $348 billion, up a bit quarter-over-quarter. That's despite us not chasing rates so we are priced appropriately we think in our deposits and I just will make one point here that we do expect to see some declines in the second half of the year in these levels as we deliberately reprice downward some very high priced Washington Mutual CDs that were put on the books for 12 months in the fall of last year. So that will be a dynamic that will see a little bit of downward pressure in that number in the second half of the year but otherwise feel very good about the underlying growth stats and Retail Banking and you'll see the P&L in a second and then our Consumer Lending at the bottom, I""ll just point out, you can read the numbers for yourself but of the total $150 billion of lending we did in the quarter, about just shy of $50 billion of it came through these consumer categories that you see here that I just referred to. But remember, I think the noteworthy piece is that our mortgage volumes of $41 billion or so is definitely affected by our decision to steer clear of broker originated volumes so that's certainly a difference from where we have been a year ago and in prior periods but for several quarters now since we made that final decision to move out of that it's been a differentiator. We're picking up less volume and you'll see that on the next page when we talk about Consumer Lending. So now moving on to page seven. total P&L for the retail business, $15 million profit if you look at the circled number on the left and walking down the Retail Banking piece of that made just shy of $1 billion, $970 million. Obviously the substantial increase year-over-year, $296 million in profits largely driven by the WaMu acquisition so clear evidence there that you see WaMu delivering a profitability that we expected and I talked about, and as well, some profit lift on a sequential quarter basis as well. Do have a little bit of higher credit costs there related to the business banking business and then moving down to Consumer Lending, obviously a disappointing loss of nearly $1 billion offsetting the profitability of the Retail Banking side, so there in terms of what's going on versus last quarter, this quarter we had very modest positive gains in our MSR Risk Management results versus making about $1 billion in each of the prior quarters, so this quarter more in line with usual expectations than kind of what we talked about there, and then credit costs, the big driver, $3.5 billion which includes $1.1 billion of addition to loan loss allowance, so I'm going to in a second go through those portfolio by portfolio. So now, if we just move on to Slide 8, let me just, I wanted to just talk about the impact of foreclosure moratoriums and modifications and what it means to some of the credit stats you all look at, so as I said at the beginning, we're active and going to continue to be in modifying mortgages. I think it's the right thing. We do it where it makes sense to us and it makes sense to our clients and for good economic reasons here. But a little bit of misunderstanding maybe about some of the ways that this impacts. So I'll let you read most of this but just make a few points. On the left, we definitely saw as all did a build up in loans that were delinquent in all of the delinquency statistics given that we suspended foreclosures during the moratoriums in the fall and spring of this year which are described on that side of the page. What I would say is that those will sit there longer in a delinquency bucket so our prime and subprime you see elevated delinquency stats but we don't expect it to have meaningful accounting or income statement impact because as we came out of those moratoriums we originally written down those loans and made adjustments to the write-downs to take account of the longer timelines to move them through into real estate owned and foreclosure, if appropriate, or modify them. So then on modifications, again, I said at the beginning we've approved 138,000 modifications for the second quarter here, but those don't have any meaningful impact on our second quarter stats, and that's because we have to see three-monthly payments under the terms of the new modification before we'll reunderwrite that loan and it comes out of delinquency and in the meantime, and there's an example here, it just continues to roll through delinquency buckets as it otherwise would have per the contract of the term. When we do see, if we do see and we hope to see good success with these modifications perhaps next quarter and in future quarters we'll talk about just the success rate but given that these are largely speaking payment reduction modifications that are done reunderwritten with real income stats and so forth, we are hopeful that we see some good rates of success in the trial period. But when we do modify, you just see the description at the bottom of how we take into account when we adjust our reserves at the time we modify the expected remaining losses including an assumption for recidivism or redefault, so that's the way it really works and we can spend more time offline if folks want to spend other time but it's not a material impact to any of the stats in this quarter was the point for today. Now I'm going to be very quick going through the next three slides so I'm just make some common points. So the first point is that obviously when you look at home equity prime and subprime, you're going to see the charge-offs continue to trend higher versus prior periods and in a couple of cases prime and subprime we up our future guidance. But the second point is that across each of these portfolios, so I just want to say it once, they flow into the early delinquency buckets and the dollar value of loans that are sitting in the early delinquency buckets has started to stabilize. Looking back over the last 60, 90 days across-the-board so that's a new trend versus what we've seen previously and obviously, we don't know if it's going to sustain itself but obviously if it did that would have good implications for future loss trends and could mean that we could be getting near to the end of needing to add to reserves in these portfolios. Just something to watch and point out, we don't know what the future holds obviously but an observation of what's going on in the early delinquency buckets across-the-board. So on Slide 9, I'll just quickly hit numbers here so you see in the upper right charge-offs of $1.265 billion, in home equity in the quarter, up a bit from last quarter but the pace of growth slowing down a little bit and we continue to have our forward guidance of quarterly losses trending to down at the bottom last bullet trending to about $1.4 billion a quarter over the next several quarters. Doing the same thing on Slide 10 for prime, upper right box, you see $481 million in net charge-offs, up more substantially from last quarter, in percentage terms but similar dollar terms and quarterly losses upping the guidance here to something maybe $100 million higher to the range of $600 million or so over the next several quarters whereas last time it was $500 million. And then finally on subprime on Slide 11, $410 million of losses in net charge-offs in the upper right in the quarter and quarterly guidance trending to about $500 million or so, that used to be $375 million to $475 million for people keeping track at home. And so one last point before I move off retail on to card, I just want to make a comment on the WaMu credit impaired portfolio that we acquired from WaMu markdown, the time we did the deal in the fourth quarter. Just make the point we have no slides in here and no news is good news on that front. What we're experiencing is losses that are coming in consistent with our original assumptions so seeing nothing to suggest that we have any need for further impairments based on what we see right now. So just wanted to make that point and obviously we'll bring that to your attention in the future if ever we do start to see trends that are worrisome. In Card, let me just move now to Slide 12. Obviously a disappointing loss of $672 million in the quarter. Credit costs is the big story, $4.6 billion of credit costs, most of that is charge-offs. We did add $250 million to loan loss reserves there. Now for Chase, the Chase portfolio versus the run-off subprime WaMu portfolio, the Chase portfolio was a charge off rate of 8.97%, up about 200 basis points as we said last earnings call in this quarter versus the first quarter, and obviously very high but coming in as expected and looking ahead to next quarter, think of that number being in the 10% range and really beyond that it's going to be a function of where the economy and unemployment goes. And the WaMu side behaving consistent with the trend forward that we'll talk about on the outlook slide of trending towards the 18% to 24% range of losses that we talked about for that run-off portfolio. Next point on Card is just charge volumes so you see charge and sales volume, sales being just a spend piece on cards declined 7% year-over-year. That number is starting to stabilize. We look at it weekly but 7% down year-over-year, together with us being less active in promoting balance transfers equates to downward pressure on our outstanding, so you see $148 billion end of period outstandings on the Chase side versus $150 billion last quarter contributing to some revenue pressure in the business overall. I will just say here, it relates to revenues but one comment to make that in the quarter we did on the card securitization side take actions to support the securitization trust that caused the regulatory assets, the rich weighted assets in those, for cards to come on balance sheet for regulatory capital purposes. I'll show you more about that later when we do capital and that also did negatively impact revenues a bit in the quarter so revenues in card would have otherwise been essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to the commercial bank on Slide 13, we had net income of $368 million, up a bit year-over-year on WaMu making a bit of a contribution here and up $30 million quarter-over-quarter. I will point out circled numbers $106 billion of ending loan balances so we do see reduced client demand on the lending side and commercial bank there to do extend credit but demand is definitely coming down. We're seeing that effect on the balance sheet footings. Revenues in the business, $1.5 billion up substantially year-over-year, again part WaMu and also driven by record non-interest revenues up inclusive of record Investment Banking revenues in the commercial bank in the quarter. Credit similar trends to what we've seen before, 67 basis points of charge off rates and some additions to loan loss allowance bringing that to just shy of 3%. So again, we see the trends as we expected of normalizing credit late cycle things moving into non-performer status and credit costs charge-offs trending higher, but reserves positioned well in anticipation of all that. Next is Treasury and security services on Slide 14. Here I'd just say it's been steady, consistent results here in the business, $379 billion of profits, up from last quarter, some seasonal strength there, liability balances $234 billion down a bit quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, seeing some normalization in liquidity flows, liability balance flows on the client side and assets under custody down a bit year-over-year and up a bit quarter-over-quarter. That drives the revenue side $1.9 billion in total flattish in the cash management side and a little down in security services side, given the lower levels of assets under custody given markets and lower activity in the securities lending side. Last business on Slide 15, Asset Management, net income here a similar story to TSS, steady results here, $352 million of profits up a good amount quarter-over-quarter and down only slightly versus the prior year. So we're recovering as market values on the assets under management recover, so $1.2 trillion in assets under management, down just 1% on a year-over-year basis and up $50 billion quarter-over-quarter. Slowdown in assets under management flows still $125 billion for the last year and $3 billion for the last quarter. And then I guess the big point is that investment performance is what drives results in this business over time, so you can see in our supplement and see on this slide towards the bottom that we have continued good investment performance, Mutual Funds 80% ranked in the first or second quarter and the quartiles over five years and so on for past three and past one year when you read through that. Corporate on Slide 16, so take it piece by piece, obviously a lesser level of write-downs on our private equity position so you have $6.6 billion of carrying value and private equity written down a touch for net losses of $27 million in the quarter. Outlook continues to be for challenging valuation levels in that piece of things but improvement from where we were over the last several quarters, and then the corporate segment you see about $1 billion of after-tax profit here. Here I'll just simply say that we had a couple of items trading gains in our investment portfolio, $820 million and that's separate and above the net interest margin we get from running a higher investment portfolio. That net interest margin was high and will continue to be high so long as we sit where we are which we currently expect to. But the trading gains, certainly they're volatile, or this is an abnormally high level, I'll point that out at $820 million after-tax. We did sell some MasterCard shares, $150 million to the positive and this is also where we booked the FDIC special assessment of $419 million after-tax. You take those yourself to normalize what that corporate line would be, but it's nearly $0.5 billion of profits and again that would be driven by the positive spread on the investment portfolio. Page 17, Capital Management, so here very proud of these numbers. Tier 1 capital $122 billion, Tier 1 common capital of $97 billion, again Tier 1 capital ratio very strong at 9.7% and Tier 1 common at 7.7%. As I said on the card page, this includes the consolidation of $40 billion of risk weighted assets in the quarter related to the Card business. So you can see in the bullet that just projecting forward to the impact of the consolidation of off balance sheet vehicles pursuant to the FASB changes that are coming January 1, of next year, our rough estimate is that the remaining impact could be about 40 basis points when you look at the other off balance sheet items and other accounting that would go along with that. But ultimately obviously there's ongoing interpretation around those rules so things could change between here and there. Page 18, just shows you the loan loss reserve piece. This is loan loss reserve of $29 billion, there's another $1 billion related to lending related commitments and the $30 billion I talk about earlier and you just see the expected trend of loan loss to total loans trending higher earlier and as non-performing loans come up as the downgrades that are anticipated along the way evolve, you see the ratio of reserves to non-performing loans coming down. But still we show those ratios for consumer, wholesale, and firm wide at the bottom and very comfortable with where we sit there. But obviously, the future economic conditions are going to dictate whether we are in fact near the end or not, but we believe we could be getting close. On the Outlook slide,page 19, you got the Investment Bank again. We don't know what the future holds, uncertain environment obviously continues, there's still risks out there and trading can be volatile so no real guidance there, make your own assumptions. Retail, I just recap what the loss projections that we talked about in each of the main portfolios. We do expect continued underlying growth there. On the Card Services side, you see the 10% loss rate for next quarter that we plus or minus talked about for the Chase portfolio, and 24%, 18% to 24% is where WaMu is going to go. But we do expect continued pressure on revenues given lower consumer spend levels, having an effect on outstandings. Commercial bank, the underlying growth is good. We like gaining the market share there. We do have strong reserves but credit trends will continue to normalize. Treasury and Security Services and Asset Management nothing to really point out. You can read for yourself. And private equity and corporate I just hit the key points there. So, with that, Operator, I'd like to just throw it open to questions.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hi, Glenn.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Largely stable. I mean, you hit on it, with the run-off in some of the portfolios compression in some of the investment portfolio and Investment Bank trading type of assets that's the real change quarter-over-quarter from first to second and net interest margin and a little decline in dollars overall, I'd expect it to be flattish best I can tell looking ahead from here to the third quarter.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: This is Jamie. That agency is just being
MIKE CAVANAGH: Non-performers I think on that last slide is about $14 billion and criticized overall it's in the credit stats in the supplement, Glenn. I don't have it handy.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I would say that it's in those early buckets. We're starting to just see the same as similar commentary to the home equity and mortgage space but again, it's early, John, to draw big conclusions from that but early buckets starting to look for stable, as is consumer spend. I mean spend in card what we see is declines at 7% year-over-year that you see in our charge volume kind of indicative of where spend is overall and you're starting to see it stabilize at that kind of level so weaker than where it was versus a year ago but better than the worst point and trending a little bit more stable but again, we don't know how long it holds on.
JAMIE DIMON: The real reason is the balances are going down a little bit. All of charge-offs will be about the same, balance will be going down a little bit and the front end is obviously notoriously fickle, but part of that at least in my opinion relates to the fact it's the rate of change of unemployment claims. So I think once unemployment levels off you may see that number actually start to come down a little bit and we don't know that, but there are good reasons to believe that.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Glenn, it's going to be, it's your notion of what your expected embedded losses are so it's really dictated from here on things like as Jamie just said, what -- does the unemployment rate stabilize or does it keep changing and same with broader economic trends as it relates to the corporate side as well.
MIKE CAVANAGH: They need that stuff to stabilize a bit before you get to a place where if you think your losses are peaking out there, looking out a year and beyond, you get to the point where you can consider that to be the, given how strongly reserve we feel we are, that would be the indicator that we're at the end.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Generally speaking, yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It is. It is.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Well CVA/DVA very complicated obviously so in Credit Portfolio, we manage the change in value of derivative assets and liabilities, counterparties in our own credit spread. That collective CVA/DVA impact was a couple hundred million dollars positive in the quarter but any given quarter sometimes they neutralize, sometimes they don't but there was a modest positive in there and what was managed in Credit Portfolio but the preponderance of the negative was the accounting asymmetry where we hedge some of our traditional accrual book loans, the $70 billion of retained loans in the Investment Bank excess held positions and so forth, we have hedges that are mark-to-market instruments and with tightening credit spreads in the quarter, those dropped in value with no offset because of the accrual loans don't get marked and so that negative was partially offset by CVA/DVA. It's a function of spreads, it's very hard to predict that line. All I can do is explain it to you one quarter to the next or you can look at a long term trend and put a place holder in there and we'll explain it quarter by quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: And we don't expect unemployment to get worse so we kind of built that in a little bit.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes, though on Card we have a lot of visibility into next quarter as opposed to this. This is more erratic.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's correct.
JAMIE DIMON: Well,on the one line it's revenues only, but for the total economics, exactly right.
JAMIE DIMON: There was one.
MIKE CAVANAGH: One or two.
JAMIE DIMON: But that would be idiosyncratic and the fact is the reserves are very high. It's hard to imagine you're going to really need more reserves but the actual losses, NPAs will go up and the actual losses will bounce all around the place. And then the final question I have is on the credit enhancement that you talked about for the card securitization, can you give us an idea of the order of magnitude in terms of the increase of your funding cost that you're seeing there because of the need to credit enhance more?
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's not that so much Guy, it's we've put new receivables in and issue notes that are zero discount and depresses revenues so it's just increasing credit enhancement in those trusts from about 11% to about 14%, creates a revenue--.
JAMIE DIMON: It's actually underlying interest costs at all, those are all existing deals and the new deals we've done obviously some were done at LIBOR plus 300, 200 or 100 basis points, or something like that. It's just the accounting for it.
JAMIE DIMON: No. You're confusing apples and oranges. The securitizations are purely an accounting thing where it cost us a couple million dollars this quarter because we did the enhancement. Whether we finance the balance sheet or not is purely what's the cheapest way to finance the balance sheet? I mean it's unlikely in 2010 going forward we would be doing credit card securitizations at all.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a timing issue and that's all it is.
JAMIE DIMON: It doesn't change that we actually underwrite credit cards.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hi, Betsy.
JAMIE DIMON: So first of all, we just fund the balance, we simply make a decision on how to fund it and it's more likely than not the firm will just fund it, because it will be cheaper than doing securitizations and as you know we have a lot of liquidity and funding capability and I think the requirement is, it comes over at fair value but basically in addition to reserves below the line, which is capital which is why when it goes to the balance sheet it doesn't change risk weighted assets but reduces your tangible common equity.
MIKE CAVANAGH: So that's all factored into the 40 basis point expected January 1 impact.
MIKE CAVANAGH: On the Chase related assets there will be a GAAP leverage ratio impact but not a ratio we worry about.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, on mods, I mean on moratoriums, the point is that loans that would otherwise have gone to foreclosure if left in delinquencies and would have been in REO have been sort of stuck in the delinquency bucket so delinquency stats, delinquency levels of later buckets like 90 day plus are just going to be elevated for a period of time until those suspended foreclosures get worked through so that's just a timing issue, you got a little bit of a double up inside the later buckets there, but no economic impact because we write assets down in those later buckets to what we think we'll realize when we sell them, so that's stayed true throughout, and then you will see--.
JAMIE DIMON: You will see foreclosures go up when this is over because the P&L has already been reflected it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And then on the modification side it's no impact on anything yet because if you're 60 days delinquent and then you start a modification, a modified loan and make your first payment, if it's less than your contractual payment you'll still roll to the 90 day bucket in the delinquency stats. So there is no, and that's what that example on that page is intended to display. If you successfully complete the repayments under your new modification, your loan would then be successful as a trial mod and then become an official rewritten loan and then it would come out of delinquencies.
JAMIE DIMON: It didn't affect P&L.
JAMIE DIMON: NPAs are higher. In the future, it will bring down NPAs and we'll disclose that to you at the time.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, and it's all given the loss given default but some of them are 100% losses and we recognize as charge-offs and some we have a valid second lien which we expect to be paid off so it's really different in different circumstances.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, except, remember the reserving, we're looking forward in forecasting.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so I wouldn't call it a target. I think what we're really saying is we expect it to be around there. I think after that, to get out of TARP and stuff, we are asked to raise another $5 of common equity and this shows you why we didn't really think we needed to, so we're growing what I would call excess capital and we don't really think that there's a reason to have much more than 7% or something like that and we're going to wait and see what the rules are because obviously those will change. Before we do a dividend we would really like to see the change in delinquencies, charge-offs and the economy so we have a little more certainty going forward about the environment. We still have a huge stock purchase program and we're going to be opportunistic and we think we can buy a lot of stock back, we have the wherewithal to do a good job for shareholders and still maintain a fortunate balance sheet we'll consider that at any point in time.
JAMIE DIMON: I would, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: To make more money for shareholders.
JAMIE DIMON: No. Because it depends what the stock price is, so when our preferreds were down at $0.50 on the dollar I wanted to buy those back too but because of TARP we weren't able to do it. So look, I'm not going to tell you what price we're going do it but I'm just saying that a rational person would say at one point you might actually do something like that depending where the stock goes and what your options are.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Normalized earnings power.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hi, Mike.
JAMIE DIMON: So CIT it will be basically immaterial. The corporate NPAs are going to go up. Remember you reserve for those as the credits got downgraded so it's really reflected in the 8% loan losses in large corporate. And California, are you talking about corporate or consumer?
JAMIE DIMON: Look, we are in business in California forever, so we're not going to be guessing about the next six months. We're building branches, we're still underwriting mortgages and small business loans and all of the things we need to do. Our standards, like Loan to Value in certain markets is a little bit lower than 80% just to protect ourselves from numbers going down, California has always been very resilient. In fact we see little signs, a lot of the MSAs markets there, they've actually had up prices and home prices in the last couple of months, and that's a positive, they've been going down for the better part of two or three years so you could argue that California is starting to see a little bit of return and in terms of building the business we're going to build the business and not guess and pull in and out because we think it may get worse or better in the short run.
MIKE CAVANAGH: In part, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the second you see things really stabilize, we won't need any additional reserves. That could be as early as next quarter, that could be some time next year.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We just don't know.
JAMIE DIMON: But I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be some additional reserve builds the next two quarters but it's possible that we actually start to see an improvement that that will be wrong. $30 billion is a lot of reserves. We're 8% in Investment Banking, almost 3% in Commercial Banking and we have huge numbers across everything else. The second you see things start getting better there will be excess reserves.
JAMIE DIMON: CNT went down to the extent we got rid of broker related CNT, but it went up to the extent the traditional correspondents, banks and stuff like that picked up share and we don't have any other detail to share with you now.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's the correspondent line.
JAMIE DIMON: And modifications are hard to do. We've hired hundreds, thousands of people, we've opened up a lot of offices, we've written new systems. It's a complex process and unfortunately we have a backlog and we're trying to whittle that down. When you look at mods, separate MODs before, which are more traditional, people deferring payments, putting them back in from the new mods where you actually have reduction in payments or reduction in principal. It is very early to tell, we're hopeful it will be good but it's very early to tell.
JAMIE DIMON: So this is a baseline, okay? The MSR is short duration, it's short volatility, and it's short the mortgage basis. We're constantly adjusting future assumptions of what we think about the whole portfolio. By product, 5s, 5.5s, 6s, Fannie Mae, FHAs, MODS, et cetera, we're always doing that and the baseline is to be hedged there but obviously make decisions about when to unhedge some of those exposures and I mentioned the three major ones and yes, things like mods obviously will change duration and we try to incorporate that into what we do. We're not punting on the MSR and taking big bets on it.
JAMIE DIMON: Sure, believe me we will adjust for that so I think even if you--.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Our forward assumptions do the best they can in terms of how the assets going to behave to predict that so that we can hedge it the best we can.
JAMIE DIMON: Even if you hedged 100% of those things, you're still going to have a swing by hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter because obviously what actually happened and what you model predicts, it will always be different.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it's all the fees in the corporate mods--.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You're talking Commercial Bank.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it's really the Investment Bank you're referring about modifications where you have a change in terms and conditions and fees and extensions and it's negotiated one by one. It's a good thing, we get paid to do it, all the fees in the Investment Bank but it also helps the companies, you get paid more in the short run and you have to do it deal by deal, and that includes stuff that's non-performing, it includes stuff which is in default, it includes stuff which is not even near default, and very often, the credit gets better because they do things to make the credit better so that you get the lenders to modify the loans.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And then in the Commercial Bank there's higher levels particularly in the mid corporate space of activity tapping into capital markets so the Investment Bank, I'm sorry the Commercial Bank piece I think of investment banking fees or fees that were associated with were $300 million or so running north of the $1 billion run rate we talked about when we did the JPMorgan-Bank One deal for the year-to-date.
JAMIE DIMON: That's not modifications.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's not modifications that's just sort of share of syndicated loan underwriting fees largely speaking.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Very little.
JAMIE DIMON: We have exposure to CIT secured/unsecured but I'm telling you, the initial, the primary and direct effect in the P&L would be not material to us. You're talking about the secondary effect, like to those companies that they deal with, have some issues, I'm sure there would be something there but I wouldn't think that would be a major thing and remember even companies in bankruptcy continue to service accounts and things like that. Obviously, if we have clients involved in that or participation, when we looked at that we think we're fine but we'll be engaged trying to minimize the impact of that. Net-net it wouldn't be material.
JAMIE DIMON: Charge-offs you mean?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Industry, media, and one in particular, a little telecom so it's not commercial real estate.
JAMIE DIMON: It's going to always be idiosyncratic. We have some big company that goes bankrupt, you have a $200 million charge-off. You may have already reserved for some of it by the way so that's why we say it's always idiosyncratic. The reserves are high, non-performers go up, charge-offs are going to be very lumpy.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I mean, as we've said before, in the near term meaning this year and next, it's going to be hard to see how we turn a profit in the card business, and for the very dynamics you just said, we'll do the best we can, but it's beyond that and anticipating how to reshape the business as we deal with the credit environment we're currently in and then deal with the legislative changes and business practice changes, we will get to a business that over the horizon that I was just referring to earns a good return and it will be whatever size business on the lending side can generate a good return on capital.
JAMIE DIMON: But it won't be next year. The way to look at it is a big part of that business is fine. It earns a decent return. We don't have to make a lot of changes and then there's a chunk of it, 30% or 40% we're going to have to make some real changes. So a reasonable expectation is that revenues are stressed a little bit next year, charge-offs are high and the business loses money. And the legislation itself, all things being equal is very hard, all things being equal how all of the competitors respond to it and it's already in my number about losing money but that will cost $500 million, $600 million, $700 million next year (Company corrected after the conference call).
JAMIE DIMON: Right. I'll be really clear. If you hedge 100% of your models and you do your models well you're going to have a swing of a couple hundred million dollars a quarter no matter what but it will net out over time.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And we call that the MSR risk management revenue. You can see that in our press release.
JAMIE DIMON: It's just how actual pay downs and products act versus what your model said.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That was $81 million positive this quarter but as Jamie says you look back over time on average that's in the range of plus or minus several hundred million bucks.
JAMIE DIMON: And in addition, we sometimes make decisions that make that number bigger or smaller. There are times we are not going to hedge mortgage basis and volatility. We could be right or wrong, there may be even times we don't hedge all of the duration as a business matter, so assuming you're 100% hedged you have a couple million dollar swing and it could be a lot more than that depending on if we change how we position it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And we talk about it when we do so, like that's what happened in the last two quarters where we had $1 billion positive numbers it was on the back of delivered decisions.
JAMIE DIMON: Hi, Jeff.
JAMIE DIMON: We've seen a small increase in prime broker in the last quarter or so, but our ongoing assumption is that you're going to have a lot of competition, and investment banking is a very competitive business and there's no reason to think that we're going to be a beneficiary from people having problems in the future so all of the big competitors are still there and they are still very good.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, if you're talking about next quarter it's awful hard to answer that question, but I think if you look and obviously it's still in a pretty big recession but the quarter before there was huge fixed income and this quarters equity I think there will be a lot of people who are raising debt and equity or preferreds to recapitalize and refinance the balance sheets and obviously it will be lumpy and whether the markets willing to accommodate big supplies of those things, but it's also been a global phenomenon. So when you look at it global it's possible you'll continue to have pretty active investment banking fee markets as people try to change and fix the balance sheets and get ready for new environments but your guess is as good as ours.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Think of that as pretty much excess revenues, generally positive over type, a little bit volatility but at this level it was much higher than normal.
JAMIE DIMON: Most of that portfolio is held for -- AFS, so it doesn't have a trading gain or loss and obviously because of the markets we took advantage of buying certain things in there that we obviously were right to buy but they had to by their nature be put in a trading portfolio, so it will be a little volatile but we don't expect -- don't expect big gains like that, put it that way. And you saw last year when Fannie Mae went bankrupt, we had to write-down the preferred, big loss. So this is the flip side. We did buy the bank preferreds and stuff like that but had to go in trading portfolios so this is just a flip side.
JAMIE DIMON: I'll give you a general comment. Commercial real estate in the United States of America is going to get worse consistently over the next several quarters. That should not be a surprise to anybody. Of course, real estate is idiosyncratic. Because you have good developers, you have good underwriters, you have good down payments, you have good equity, did you build a good building, are you in a good place, all those various things. We've got two major real estate exposures, we have what we call CTO which is multi-family smaller loans, it's performing fine and we actually--.
MIKE CAVANAGH: What we got from WaMu, that's the Commercial Bank, $30 billion portfolio from WaMu.
JAMIE DIMON: It will get worse but we don't expect it to be significant, materially significant to our numbers, and we also have a more traditional real estate portfolio but I would say both at Bank One, JPMorgan and Chase, we've been so conservative of the last eight or nine years it's been doing nothing but in general shrinking other than the acquisition of WaMu and yes loss, what's the number on the--?
JAMIE DIMON: And losses are, charge-offs were--?
JAMIE DIMON: 186 basis points and the Commercial Term Lending was 36 and both will get worse but they aren't that big a number for us as is going to be completely significant. It is a big deal for regional banks.
JAMIE DIMON: Half the business won't change at all, and I think it's a mistake to look at it as spend or borrow because a lot of people do a little bit of both so certain like airline cards and stuff, I don't think they will change that much. It's more spend, there's a little borrow and there's parts of the business which will change forever. You're not going to have fixed rate cards, you're going to have much lower people offering to do balance transfers, you can't offer low rates to certain customers because you can't, those almost will be out there forever under the new laws. So my guess is the end of the day the business will be smaller, I don't know, 10% or 15% but it will return to normal profitability because otherwise you wouldn't be in the business at all and obviously some of the borrow business will be gone forever. I think people will be required to do less subprime which we don't do but I think in the business there will be less of that. So and I think it may take a couple years to get back to that place but it will be a decent business again and we have particularly competitive advantage because we think there's an enormous advantage to having branches, customers, cross-selling, we know the credit acts better when you have a deposit account so hopefully you'll see us come up with great new products.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And partners, business, and rewards associated with it will be a big deal as well and we will like our position there.
JAMIE DIMON: So we've disclosed this before that credit card losses have a direct and highly correlated to both unemployment and to home prices and obviously home prices and unemployment have a pretty direct correlation too. So when you've had chronically high unemployment, you've also had chronically high losses, I do believe at one point when unemployment stabilizes, losses stabilize and even start to trend down.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We don't have enough places where we see that stabilization to give the REIT but we believe that to be true.
JAMIE DIMON: And with more careful underwriting you'll see the benefit of that. You already see for example, in auto loans which have a much shorter duration so you can actually more quickly adjust underwriting that there has been an improvement in credit all things being equal.
MIKE CAVANAGH: All right, thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, the first thing I'll tell you is I don't really pay much attention to VAR, because I think it's an artificial -- I mean it's a good single point measure, but that's not, doesn't tell you the risk you took all quarter of things you did. Yes, we had good cash, good derivatives, great primary issuants, and on hedging and stuff like that we're on the wrong side of the market.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Nope. Just do it, it's all idiosyncratic so it's position by position valuations. It's hard to make a general comment compared to anybody else on that score.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No. Like we said only hesitant in that I don't have the ability to see into the future, so we are seeing and it's been pretty steady now for several months the early bucket delinquency rates stabilizing, and you see we didn't up our near term loss guidance in that portfolio, so for what that's worth, recent trends have been decent in home equity.
JAMIE DIMON: You talking about investment banking?
JAMIE DIMON: It's okay, but pipelines, we don't usually refer to pipelines because they are fickle too and meaning that you can have a huge pipeline equity but there's nothing you can do about it and it disappears if the markets aren't there for it but it's okay.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but if you asked the same question before last quarter, I would have said okay and we had great underwriting quarter.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You don't necessarily see all of the activity sitting in the pipeline at the get go.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I mean, no. Strength generally is what we mean. A little bit of differentiation but nothing to really draw attention to.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think you've got what we see is the results of that reflected in our numbers this quarter.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Good morning.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think the only thing I can mention, Nancy, no, generally but the only thing I mentioned is that in looking at the Washington Mutual deposits there's some very high rate time deposit money that will likely roll off where it's not related to an existing retail branch customer, we're not going to be chasing, holding on to those kind of hot money deposits and paying a price to do it, so that will obviously effect the levels of NIM and the retail business.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think it was pretty good as we talked about going back to the deal closed late september, right? So when we talked about it during our October earnings call it was the early read that we had immediately stabilized the behavior there and then with the stuff that's gone on in that business so for the core activity real retail clients it's behaving nicely. As I said there is a chunk of the deposit base there that is sort of non-affiliated, non-client just attracted by the rate, so that's going to behave a little differently but we're fine with that.
JAMIE DIMON: I think that it's a very good question and there are some people out there with kind of less lower jumbo rates than we have and we are doing them. We've been very conservative. We'll probably be a little more aggressive going forward.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And we focused on our own clients to begin with.
JAMIE DIMON: But jumbo spreads to conforming have come in. For a while they were very high and I'm going to say they were 75 to 125 basis points today.
JAMIE DIMON: Who did?
MIKE CAVANAGH: U.S. Bancorp:
JAMIE DIMON: Did we do the analysis and--?
MIKE CAVANAGH: We're working on it. So I dealt with that one, Nancy. So we are basically just following the governments process, so we made an offer, the government didn't take us up on that offer so in the natural process, we've allowed then rather than go through a negotiated or rather a pretty convoluted appraisal process have allowed them just to take it to a public auction given what their announced intentions are so we don't know anything yet on the timing for that or how exactly they will carry that forward.
MIKE CAVANAGH: But we're totally fine, it's a reason to understand their approach and what they're trying to get done.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I would answer the second question first which is yes, I think we've picked up share over time. That's actually been reflected in some analysis we do and look at client share in Fixed Income because throughout this whole crisis, we've been open, making markets and trading and obviously some people weren't and spreads have been coming down. Obviously they were very high, ridiculously high, no one has the right to expect it that high and our ongoing assumption would be that there should probably be decent client volume and spreads are going to come down and we see it happen in various products already.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think they came down over the course of the second quarter and it's best we would assume competition comes back and knocks them a little bit tighter.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so we do it fairly consistently to how we've always done it and it's a risk adjusted measure so that number can bounce around any particular quarter depending on how the revenues earned, where they were earned and things lie that so like anybody else we're going to be competitive in investment banking comp. We have a very good business, we're very proud of the results there and that number will jump around. We do it every quarter. It's not like we do a high number three quarters and a low number the fourth quarter so it's probably more level than other people actually do it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: But we don't know the second half of the year obviously and that's when we'll really figure it out for good.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I would just say it's when we look at it on a six-month year-to-date basis we're comfortable with where we sit.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes, I think the six-month level as Jamie said, underlying approach is very much risk-based, so comp to revenue is not a great proxy but it's the best you all can do, so I take the first six months as a way to approach it for second half.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You talking about the firm or the investment bank?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Just the things we pointed out, FDIC expense and so forth.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Richard, I think--.
JAMIE DIMON: We want our market share to improve in every business. I don't think it's a bad thing corporate loans are going down because a lot of them are going down because pep are accessing capital markets and that's a good thing and we do business with that too so in terms of building the business, just as a business matter and more philosophical statement, we're going to have great bankers going in great clients doing real business the best way we can do it. We open branches, we do our marketing and the revenues are going to bounce around. You can forecast GDP and unemployment and global just like we can, so that's your job to do that. We're going to build the business relentlessly day in and day out with great products and great services and great people. And with profits and revenues will be what they are.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Great. I think that's the last of the questions, so thank you everybody and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",0.22000000000000006,-0.6190000000000011,0,0.0874060680417077,0.10114781841772295
27,Q1_2020,"
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So ﬁrst ofall, I'll start with the payment reliefand forbearance there. I would start by saying that we have already refunded millions of dollars in fees. We've approved payment relief for hundreds of thousands of accounts across consumer lending. And we obviously expect that to be meaningfully higher through time. We paused foreclosures and auto repossessions. And importantly, we've made the process easier for our customers through digital and self-service options thatwe built in record time. But in terms of what we're seeing, those are the numbers. They're still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we thinkwe'll ultimately see. In mortgage, just to give you context outside of customers asking for forbearance, which isjust a little over 4% of our service book at this time, the April 1 payments seems BAU. |n Card, we're seeing payment rates down a bit but still strong, and we've seen a slight uptick in late payments in Auto. But the quality of these portfolios was strong coming in as we've done surgical risk management over the last few years, and that has made these portfolios more resilient. And then in terms ofhow we thinkabouta signiﬁcant government intervention, I mean, I thinkthe ultimate effectiveness of these programs, which are extraordinary in terms of the direct payments or the enhanced unemployment insurance, the ultimate effectiveness is, I think, the biggest unknown. The key, obviously, is being able to bridge people back to employment. And so we have assumed, as we could for our ﬁrst quarter results, the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that we'll be providing to our customers. But that is for sure an unknown, and we certainly expect to learn a lot more about that in the second quarter.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So Mike, as we close the books for the first quarter, just to give it context, we were looking at an economic outlook that had GDP down 25% in the second quarter and unemployment above 10%. |t'sjust important to note that, that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it, but there's a lot more that goes into our reserving, including managementjudgment of some like world-class risk management and finance people and also other analytics. And so thatjust kind ofgives you a frame of reference. But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving. And we also thought about the impact, what's our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief programs. Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment at 20%. That's obviously materially different. Both scenarios, though, do include a recovery in the back half of the year. And so all else equal, and of course, the one thing -- probably the only thing we know for sure, Mike, is that all else won't be equal when we close the books for the second quarter. But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter. Butagain, a lot will depend on the ultimate effect of these extraordinary programs and how effective they can be in bridging people back to employment. And we're going to still have a number of unknowns, I would say, at the end of the second quarter. Butwe're going to learn a lot through these nextfew months thatwill inform ourjudgments for second quarter reserves.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: We have looked at -- the range of outcomes probably have never been broader. And so as Jamie said, we have -- CCAR has been a good place for us to start in terms of one scenario, butwe have looked at a number of different scenarios as how this may play out. And obviously, Jamie articulated what we think could be an extreme adverse, and we're prepared for that, too. So I think the most important thing is that we're prepared for a range ofoutcomes. and we'll learn more about SCB in June.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on the investment securities portfolio, managing the balance sheet in this rate environment is obviously a different dynamic. And with lower rates as well as the deposit growth that you meant, with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense. Right now, in terms of balance sheet management, we are completely focused on supporting client activity. Our balance sheet is harder to predict right now, but we are prepared for a range ofoutcomes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So there, I would say that our approach -- we always take a long-term franchise View on things like that. And so our philosophy has not changed. It is true, however, that the marginal cost of new activity is higherfor us right now. And so that's a consideration. But I would say in terms of risk management, we do whatwe've always done and what we always do, which is manage carefully within our risk appetite. And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis, and we'll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. You got it, John. That's -- so we do continue to accrue, but it is a lower yield over the life of the loan.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on the Wholesale side, specifically, Betsy, the reason you see that dynamic is because ofCECL. So -- and it's in the presentation, so you can see the numbers. So we -- the CECL adoption impact in Wholesale was a net release, and so we've now built that. And so that's why you see that dynamic there. And then in terms of the reserving, when we close the books, which was here in early April, we do have to, of course, kind of snap the chalk line at some point and close the books, which is why we wanted to be very transparent about how we think about reserving going fonivard. Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we're looking at, that we would expect to have a build in the second quarter and perhaps beyond because, as I said, obviously, everything is incredibly fluid. And we need to -- we really need to learn a lot about the ultimate impact of these programs because they are extraordinary and should have an extraordinary impact, butwe need some time to learn.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right. And we...
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. And we still have, obviously, several weeks -- and so -- before the Q. And so we'll be able to give our bestview on things then.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes, there could be. But that's only where we are at this point in the quarter. And so it'll obviously all depend on the market from now to the end of the quarter. But right now, the market is performing a bit better, and spreads have come in as you mentioned.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. Chris, this is unfortunately part of our new reality as we all work remotely. We couldn't hear you.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: It may because as long as the customer is performing under the forbearance program, they are not delinquent. But of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. And we'll be -- and to Jamie's point, whatwe may learn over the next 90 days is, of course, whether programs have been effective or whether they've just delayed losses. And of course, with CECL being life of loan, if it'sjust delayed losses, you can expect that, thatwould -- we would be reserving for that.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: It may be. But again, it's going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief for a forbearance program. Butwe don't really think about it thatway. We think aboutwhat the ultimate losses will be, and we reserve for that. And then importantly, in the ﬁrst quarter, the charge-offs you're seeing, which is why I was clear to say it was consistentwith prior expectations because the charge-offs in the ﬁrst quarter, of course, don't at all reflect the ultimate impact of COVID-19. They werejust normal BAU. I would say.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. So I'm not sure specifically what program you're referring to. I would just say broadly speaking, on the Fed facilities, they're obviously very large programs rolled outvery quickly and just an extraordinary response to unprecedented market conditions. Here, we are happy to leverage the facilities to intermediate these programs for our clients, butwe are only using them where it makes sense to ensure that credit and liquidity is flowing to where it's needed.",-1.92,-3.277000000000003,0,0.114021045169301,0.15471490188643472
28,Q1_2017,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO AND EVP, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. We're off to a good start this year with net income of $6.4 billion, EPS of $1.65 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $25.6 billion with a continuing momentum from last year driving
MARIANNE LAKE: So in the retail space, the answer is no, not really. And to be completely honest, we've been pretty consistent that we would not really have expected there to be much in terms of deposit reprice at absolute levels of rates that are still quite low. And so with IOER at 100 basis points, we're still in that sort of realm of the atmosphere, and so we would expect that to start happening a couple of rate hikes from here maybe. We'll have to wait and see. We've obviously never really been through exactly this before. On the other side of the equation, in the Wholesale space, we are in the process of seeing a reprice happen.
MARIANNE LAKE: No.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I don't have all those numbers directly in front of me. I know that in the Commercial Bank, our exposure to mortgage is really pretty modest, it's around about a total of $3 billion in the commercial real estate space. And I would tell you that while there obviously is a lot of discussion around retail, and with some merit, it's very case-by-case, location-by-location-specific. And I kind of liken the discussions a lot to discussions we have around our bricks-and-mortar banking businesses, which is consumer -- the way consumers engage with retail isn't changing, it doesn't mean they will stop engaging with retailers. And so it will be very specific with respect to location and tenants. And it doesn't necessarily mean that retail is going to be in as much potential trouble as I think people are talking about. So we remain cautiously watching it but also cautiously optimistic that it's not -- that it's a bit overblown.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, I know that -- so one of the things that we want to remind everybody before we talk about the trend is that the credit card losses are still at absolutely very, very low levels. And notwithstanding whatever we would have done or have done or continue to do with our credit books, we would ultimately have expected them to normalize to higher rates regardless, so -- and then for -- obviously, the first quarter hasn't been that...
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, exactly. And obviously, first quarter has some seasonality. So I would just start by saying that the charge-off rates we're seeing are completely in line with our expectations and guidance that we gave you at Investor Day both in terms of 2017 being below 3% and over the medium term being between 3% and 3.25% for all of the reasons we articulated. A combination of positive credit expansion that took place over the last couple of years and the performance of those newer vintages is in line with our expectations and with high risk-adjusted margins. So it's not really about tolerating the charge-offs as long as we're getting paid properly for the risk, which is the case. And obviously, as we see those charge-off rates both normalize and reflect those newer vintages, they will go up modestly over time. And we expanded our credit in a targeted way, but it wasn't a significant expansion. And we will respond in our credit and risk appetite to whatever we're seeing in the environment. But it won't necessarily be predicated by charge-offs rates as long as (inaudible).
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say if you look back over 2016 and even 2015 and '16, it's true and clear that we gained share, not just in fixed income -- reasonable share not just in fixed income but also in equities. And our business performed well last year. And I would suggest to you that we will defend that share. But the competition is back and healthy. And you can't expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels. We want to defend it, but it's a healthy competitive market right now. So I would say not really.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I would also say that Cards continue to be a very competitive space. So we will continue to try and provide our customers with significant value and have deep, engaged relationships. But I don't think you're going to see material shifts in share in the short term.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not particularly at this point. I think we're very happy with the performance of the portfolios, with the growth rates we're getting. You saw that our core card loans were up 9% year-on-year. We're getting a lot of NII benefit from that. So I think we're pretty well positioned at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I would say loan growth should be in the mid- to higher single digits.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously, when we give you guidance, we give you sort of reasonably rounded numbers. So actually, the impact of current implied is a bit more than $500 million more than it was at Investor Day. But in the law of big numbers, that's a pretty reasonable amount. Yes, there is an element, of course, as we talked about, in the Wholesale space, where we are seeing reprice happen, and it does reflect our estimates of what we expect to see over the course of the year in cumulative deposit bases. And with respect to if there was -- and you know that the implied has priced in 1.5 more hikes, so it's -- obviously, March is earlier, so longer, there's a little bit more rate benefit. But it's sort of in line with our expectations. And if we had another rate hike, it would likely be later in the year, and ultimately have a relatively modest impact on this year but obviously be important going forward.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think it's important to put that slowdown into context. I mean, we did have 8% growth year-on-year in C&I. We're just saying sequentially, things are a bit quieter, and there's a whole bunch of reasons that could be driving that. And importantly, you mentioned it, when we're in dialogue with our clients, they are optimistic and they are thinking about growing their businesses and hiring, and all of those things are true. And so putting aside those that have access to capital markets for a variety of reasons in newer bank loans, it's completely understandable that optimism would lead actions. And so as to what that lag will look like, we'll wait and see. But fundamentally, a pro-growth series of policies will be constructive to the economy, to our clients, and ultimately, will end up in them hiring, spending, and they already are, and we'll see that translate into loan growth. Whether that's in the second half of this year, we'll see.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. And I would also say that while, of course, people's dialogues include a degree of discussion around regulatory reform and tax reform and the like, it isn't stopping the strategic dialogue and it isn't stopping people from -- or boards from considering strategic deals partly because of what you said, partly because there is a recognition that these things will take some time to ultimately get finalized, and that they don't want to put their strategic agenda on hold. So in some ways, you get both sides of the equation. People aren't going to wait indefinitely to get certainty on issues when there are good strategic deals that can be done, and that's past the dialogue. So not to say it has no impact, but it's still quite healthy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Maybe a little less than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I would also just say, I am glad that you brought up one point because it's something that I'd like -- a point that I'd like to make, which is when people think about the benefit we get from NII on rising rates, there's an element of people making it sound very passive. Yes, you're correct, we did build those branches, we acquired those customers, we built the product, we invested in the customer service to be able to enjoy the industry-leading deposit growth that we're having. But I would also make the -- and so as margins improve, then, we will obviously enjoy the benefit of that. And to your point, we invested to be able to. But I will say that if you -we look at the performance of our branches every single week, month, individually, put together by market, and the very, very, very vast majority of them, meaning that only a handful do not, are profitable in their own right today at these spreads on a marginal basis. So the branches are doing very well.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I can point you to a presentation in May of 2014 where we showed exactly what we expected the complexity of deposit reprice to look like based upon historical moves. So what we have actually seen to date looks incredibly similar in terms of realized reprice. You're absolutely right. I will tell you though that history may not be a precise predictor of the future because we've never really been in this exact position before and other things play into the equation, including the fact that the industry, but us specifically, have significantly invested in other customer service products, items like digital and the like, which will change the dynamic one way or another on reprice. So you're right, historically, 100, 150 basis points should dot [ph] see some movement, we'll see.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I would just start by saying we've been consistent that our operating model, including the diversification of our businesses, has been and was a source of strength not just for us but also for the financial markets during the crisis. And there is strength in the way the company operates that can't be discounted. I would also say that the commentary feels unnecessary given where the industry stands on capital liquidity and regulatory reform broadly. And I would just point, as I'm sure you all read, to most recently, Governor Tarullo making comments about this but historically, other thought leaders in the financial stability space talking about it. And I would further say that it doesn't feel, for the reasons that you just articulated in terms of structural reform or structural change in the model of banks, that, that would be consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the U.S. So that's kind of how we feel about it. I can't give you specific reasons to not continue to monitor the situation. But it doesn't feel consistent with the rest of the objectives of the administration. And with respect to Investor Day a couple of years ago, lots of things have fundamentally changed since then, but the ultimate conclusion hasn't, which is that we believe that there's significantly more value for our shareholders, and as I said before, for the economy with this company the way it is today than in some other form.
MARIANNE LAKE: First of all, we don't overthink the shape of the curve or the process of normalization in any one period. We think about the reason for the actions. And ultimately, as long as they're kind of growing, you'll see both of the short and the long end of rates ultimately go up. And even though I know that it's lower than what we've broken down, broken below a little bit of the lower bounds, it's been in the kind of 2.30%, 2.60% range for a while, so we're still within -- largely speaking, within the range. And our central case is that we're going to see the 10-year higher by the end of the year. And if you look at our earnings and risk disclosures, we're much more sensitive to -- as a pure NII, NIM matter, to the front end of rates. And so not to say it would not have an impact, but it would take a while for that to have an impact that would meaningfully offset any of the benefit of higher short-end rates.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, I mean, ultimately, sort of any actions by central banks, any change in the shape of the yield curve, anything that is presenting an opportunity for clients to transact and trade is an opportunity for our businesses. So as long as it happens in a reasonably rational fashion and there are no significant events, it should create an opportunity for clients and an opportunity therefore for us.
MARIANNE LAKE: So well, I mean -- so in terms of rates, obviously, the loan balances are seasonally low in the first quarter and charge-off rates are higher in the first quarter. But overall, we're not expecting to see abnormal patterns in our charge-offs.
MARIANNE LAKE: But we only do them to our strategic manufacturing businesses.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's actually got somewhat less to do with our marketing strategy than it has to do with the fantastic success we've had with the new products, particularly Sapphire Reserve, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year. But fundamentally, if you go back, I think, to a conference that Kevin Watters spoke at last year sometime in, I think, September, he said, look, we're going to see the revenue rate be lower about 10% and some for the couple of quarters while we acquire all of these accounts. Once we've hit a pace, we should see it middle out at 10.5% the full year of 2017, so the first quarter lower and subsequent quarters continuing to now start rising back up towards the 11.25%, which was our ultimate run rate target. And that's still fundamentally what we're expecting to see, which is we're at a -- assuming that our expectations of what we're going to see in account growth over the future period continues to hold, we would expect to see an increase from here in the second quarter, the overall year, to be sort of finish the mid-10s and the year 11-ish, and then go back to 11.25% over the course of the next couple of years.
MARIANNE LAKE: And we have great new products.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So just, Glenn, I don't know if you're still on. I've got a couple of numbers for you in terms of retail exposure. Our direct retail exposure in the wholesale space is about $20 billion, 70% -- more than 70% investment grade and more than 15% secured. And in terms of commercial real estate, about $11 billion, largely ABL, picked the right names, structural protection, all the things you talked about. So not that it's nothing, but it's -- in the context of our overall wholesale lending portfolio, it's not as concentrated, I think, as perhaps you were implying. So if you want to call Investor Relations and let us know what you were looking at, we can try and reconcile those numbers for you. Okay. Thank you, everyone.",0.1299999999999999,0.35099999999999776,1,0.12569426353718388,0.13121205792258425
29,Q1_2014,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: Thank you Operator, good morning everybody. As of right now, I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements which is at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1, the Firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the first quarter, $1.28 a share, with a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $24 billion, down 8% year on year driven by lower markets revenue, down 17%, and continued headwinds in mortgage. Reported expenses for the Firm were basically the same as adjusted expenses this quarter at $14.6 billion, in line with our expectations and our guidance for full-year adjusted expenses to be below $59 billion. Firm-wide legal expense for the quarter was immaterial. Of note, you will see that we didn't disclose any significant items this quarter on the front page of the presentation. There were items in the quarter that we consider non-core or non-recurring. Each individually didn't rise to the level of being disclosed on the front page, and importantly, the net of all such items across businesses was not significant to the Firm's reported results. To be clear, this means our reported net income of $5.3 billion is very close to being a core performance number, which we consider a solid result given the challenging environment for both markets and mortgage. Importantly, underlying drivers across most businesses continued along impressive trends. Finally, we're pleased that our capital plan was approved in the quarter, and the Board announced its intention to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 a share effective in the second quarter, as well as the authorization to repurchase a gross $6.5 billion of common equity, or net a little over $5 billion, that's net of expected employee issuance. So skipping over page 2 and turning to page 3. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.5%, flat to last quarter, being over 40 basis points of capital generated and run-off in the quarter, largely offset by the impact of certain specific risk models that were approved for use in Basel I last year, but which our regulators disapproved for use under Basel III effective at the beginning of this year. We believe it should largely be timing with partial remediation in the second half of 2014 and further remediation in 2015. The impact of these models approvals was contemplated in our Investor Day guidance of reaching 10% plus by the year end, but it won't be in a linear fashion and the majority of capital accretion will occur in the second half of the year. Effective this quarter our regulatory reported ratio moves from a Basel I measure to a Basel III standardized transitional measure, and having been approved to exit Basel parallel effective April 1, starting in the second quarter, the common floor would apply. This means that there are a variety of measures we could talk about, but suffice to say that we're hundreds of basis points above the minimum for any of them. Therefore, our primary ratio will continue to be the one we used to manage the place, which also happens to be our lowest, the fully phased-in Basel III advance ratio of 9.5%. Before we leave the page I want to spend a minute on leverage. You'll notice that the Firm and the bank SLR progressed by 50 and 70 basis points, respectively, and importantly, that the Firm is above 5% today. The Firm's ratio benefited from net retained earnings as well as from preferred issuance of close to $4 billion, as we took advantage of market opportunities in the first quarter. The bank's ratio benefited from both retained earnings as well as the impact of actions taken, including downstreaming and restructuring certain capital for the bank. Additionally, other leverage actions taken across our businesses helped the Firm and the bank by 10 basis points. We also analyzed the rule proposed by regulators this past Tuesday. In general it was relatively consistent with the Basel proposal, which is how we based our estimates. There were a couple of nuanced technical changes. The net of those changes we estimated to add approximately 15 to 20 basis points to leverage, which is included in the ratios reported on the page. Turning to the business performance and moving on to Page 4, for Consumer and Community Banking. The combined Consumer businesses generated $1.9 billion of net income for the quarter on $10.5 billion of revenue and an ROE of 15%. Overall, revenue was down both year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by Mortgage Banking, which I will talk about later. Despite margin compression across CCB, excluding mortgage, revenue was flat year on year as we continued to add new customers and deepen our relationships with them. Deposits were up $30 billion year on year. We had record client investment assets of $196 billion, up 16%, and credit card sales volume of $105 billion was up 10% year on year being the 24th consecutive quarter that sales outperformed the industry. Expense was down $350 million year on year and close to $900 million quarter on quarter, despite the ongoing investment in controls. The reduction was also driven by mortgage, as well as by the timing of certain investments in marketing and card. And across CCB, we are on track relative to our headcount reduction outlined at Investor Day. On Page 5, Consumer and Business Banking. Business generated $740 million of net income and an ROE of 27% on $4.4 billion of net revenue, up 5% year on year and down 1% from the prior quarter seasonally. Net interest income was up over 5% year on year, driven by deposit growth of 9%, among the highest in the industry; we saw strong household growth and the lowest attrition ever this quarter. While the deposit margin flattened quarter over quarter, it did decline 9 basis points over last year, driven by lower reinvestment rates. On the non-interest revenue side, we continued to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and in investment revenue, driven by the record client investment assets I mentioned. Expense was up 1% year on year, reflecting investments we've made in the business, including the costs relating to strengthening the control and compliance infrastructure, partially offset by improving efficiency in our branches. CBB headcount was down around 1,500 this quarter. On Business Banking originations we're beginning to see stronger lending, with production for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up 22% year over year and 16% quarter on quarter. We have the right team in place and targeted strategies which have proved successful. We're also seeing improved banker productivity. So although some challenges remain in the environment, the pipeline is strong and at the highest level since 2012 and utilization rates have stabilized. So we are cautiously optimistic that improved lending trends will continue in 2014. Turning to page 6, Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $114 million for the quarter, and despite a relatively favorable rate environment, the market got off to a slow start in 2014. We're seeing tight housing inventory in some markets, and the purchase market was affected adversely by the severe weather. This led to a challenging quarter for the Mortgage business with production of $17 billion, down 27% quarter over quarter and 68% over last year. On the back of this lower volume, production pre-tax excluding repurchases was a loss of $186 million, consistent with our guidance. We did, however, continue to make good progress on right sizing capacity and reducing expenses, with production core expense being lower by over $110 million quarter on quarter. Total Mortgage Banking headcount was down nearly 3,000 since the end of the year and about 14,000 since the beginning of last year. Mortgage Production also benefited from a repurchase reserve release. Repurchases for the quarter was positive $128 million, principally driven by a significant improvement in actual and projected cure rates for remaining repurchase risks. So before I move off of production, just briefly on market share. As we pointed out at Investor Day, we're pricing the business to reflect the inherent risks. The risk of default and the cost associated with servicing defaulted loans is significantly higher for high LTD loans. As a result of pricing actions taken, we believe we may have lost some share in the first quarter, but we will remain disciplined with respect to appropriate risk adjusted returns, and this is consistent with our objective to have a smaller, higher quality, less volatile mortgage business in the future. Now on to servicing. Excluding MSR risk management, pre-tax income of $131 million was favorable by over $100 million quarter on quarter. That was driven by the absence of an adjustment to compensatory fees, which we incurred in the fourth quarter. If you exclude this item, servicing pre-tax remained relatively flat, and we remain on track to deliver servicing expense of $500 million plus or minus by the fourth quarter of this year. MSR risk management was a net loss for the quarter of about $400 million. The loss was driven by a negative $460 million fair value adjustment, principally on higher allocated capital to the business, in line with the capital we showed at Investor Day. Lastly on real estate portfolios, pre-tax income of $517 million includes $174 million of charge-offs and an NCI reserve release for the quarter of $200 million, in line with guidance. You'll see that net charge-offs were broadly flat to the fourth quarter on flattening delinquencies at the end of last year and the early part of the first quarter, but we do expect improvement in the loss trend to resume in the second quarter as recent delinquency trends have been positive. Lastly on mortgage, the NCI portfolio remains flat. We added $3.5 billion of loans this quarter. Turning to page 7. Card, Merchant Services and Auto had net income of $1.1 billion, down 15% year on year with an ROE of 23%, or 20% if you exclude reserve releases. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 3% seasonally quarter on quarter and 4% year on year, driven by continued margin compression from growth in transacted balances and from the pay down of higher-yielding run-off loans. Underlying trends remain robust, strong sales and merchant processing volumes up 10% and 11%, respectively, and gaining share. Total outstandings remained approximately flat for us and for the industry, and we have strong momentum in new account originations in the quarter, up 24% year on year, and the quality of our new account origination is very strong. Expense was down $260 million or 12% quarter on quarter, due to the timing of marketing spend as well as the absence of remediation payments to customers that was recorded in the fourth quarter. The net charge-off rate has remained very low at 293 basis points, picking up slightly quarter on quarter just on seasonality of loan balances. We released $200 million of Card loan loss reserves this quarter in line with guidance, and $50 million of student lending reserves. And before we move on, a few words on Auto. We saw a very strong industry rebound in March with the highest new Auto sales since 2007, coming off of the slower start to the year, again on a severe winter. This drove originations up 3% year on year and loan balances up 5%, gaining share, and it was the 10th consecutive quarter of Auto loan and lease growth. Moving on to Slide 8 and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. You'll see in the table on the top right of the slide that we've shown adjusted results for comparable periods excluding DVA and FVA. The net DVA/FVA impact for this quarter was an insignificant loss. Gross DVA would have been over $200 million negative on 9 basis points tightening of CDS spreads, so as expected what we saw was a sensitivity to our spread significantly muted given the implementation of FVA, and you should expect the impact of DVA/FVA in our results to continue to be modest going forward, all other things equal. In Banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion down 8% year on year. IB fees were $1.4 billion, up 1% year on year, driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees but with lower debt underwriting fees, and we maintained our number-one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic. Going forward, the environment remains compelling for M&A with announced volumes up 20%. We have a robust pipeline of IPOs with a large backlog across sectors and regions, and DCM activity is expected to be relatively stable. Lending revenue was down $200 million year over year and down quarter over quarter, but mark-to-market gains on securities drove the variance in both prior periods. We also had Treasury Services revenue of $1 billion, down 3% year on year, with higher net interest income on higher deposits, offset by the impact of business simplification and lower trade loans and spreads. Moving on to markets and investor services. The challenging environment and lower client volumes we talked about at Investor Day continued through the end of the quarter, ending with overall markets revenues down 17% year on year, and there was no discernible single driver of the weakness. It was across products and regions. In general it feels like the market consensus at the quarter beginning was for a growth story which didn't transpire, and combined with several other factors this lead to generally lower levels of client activity across the board. We didn't see a meaningful pickup in activity in March, so it's reasonable to expect that some of this first-quarter softness may continue in April. Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was up 4% year on year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. And you see the credit adjustments and other line items showed a negative $197 million, which includes the net DVA/FVA loss together with the impact of changes in CVA. The credit environment continues to be benign and we believe our exposure to Russia is manageable. We are appropriately reserved based on what we know today and we are closely monitoring the situation. Expense came down 8% year on year to $5.6 billion, lower compensation given lower revenue driving the decline. The comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 33%, broadly in line with 34% in the same quarter of last year. And finally on drivers, you can see client deposit balances were up 15% year on year, but down 2% quarter on quarter seasonally. Moving on to Commercial Banking on page 9. This quarter saw net income of about $580 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 17%. Revenue was relatively flat year over year and declined by approximately $200 million sequentially. The sequential decline was about two-thirds NII, driven by a large recovery we reported in the prior quarter, together with lower day count. The balance of the decline was lower NIR on seasonally lower fees. A bright spot in the quarter was gross IB revenues of $450 million for the quarter, up over 30% year on year, a record for a first quarter, and representing nearly 35% of North America IB fees. Our credit book continued to show very strong performance with a net recovery rate of 4 basis points, and expense was up 7% year on year given the investments we've been making in the business as well as the impact of costs of control and compliance. Loan balances were up 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Consistent with recent trends, real estate growth remains really strong at 15%. Both our Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking portfolios grew in the double digits, outpacing the industry. In C&I, loan growth remains tepid and the environment remains extremely competitive. There were pockets of growth including the expansion markets, which were up 17%, and increased activity in healthcare, oil and gas, and technology sectors. With respect to pipeline, we saw the pipeline trend up or strengthen a little from the lows of last year, trending in the right direction but still relatively weak versus a year ago. Moving on to page 10, Asset Management. The quarter saw net income of about $440 million, down 9% year on year with an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 5% year on year, driven by flows and market performance, primarily Europe and the US, off of a very strong first quarter a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter revenue was down 13% despite continued inflows; two-thirds of the decline was driven by normal seasonality and performance fees. The remainder of the decline related to the change in a mark-to-market of a seed investment. We did mention $100 million or so positive mark-to-market reflected in the fourth quarter's results. We gave some of that back this quarter, driving the sequential variance impact to be over $150 million. This is the 20th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, $20 billion for the quarter, driving record AUM of $1.6 trillion, up 11% year on year, and we've seen a strong start to April. Expense increased 11% year on year, given higher investments and cost of control, and decreased 8% quarter on quarter, largely driven by lower comp on lower revenue. Lastly in Banking, we continued to see strong loan and deposit growth with record balances up 19% and 7%, respectively. Moving on to page 11 and Corporate and Private Equity. Private Equity net income of over $200 million included approximately $400 million of gains on investments in the quarter. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $94 million. NII remained relatively flat quarter on quarter at a negative $90 million (sic - see slide 11 ""$87mm""), and we continue to expect NII in Treasury and CIO to break even by the year end, driven by higher securities yields as we benefit from higher rates. Additionally, we deployed $25 billion gross of new investments in the quarter, with the portfolio being relatively flat net of maturities, pay downs, and sales. And before I continue, let me just tell you about NIM and NII for a second. The page is in the appendix. Total NIM was flat quarter on quarter and core NIM was up 2 basis points, primarily driven by higher investment securities yields, offset by loan spread compression. Finally on this page, Other Corporate net income of a little over $200 million, included in this result is a $90 million after-tax impact of writing down our deferred tax assets following changes to New York State's tax which was enacted at quarter end. This upfront impact to DTA will be offset over time. And as I said earlier, no significant legal expense to report for the quarter. It obviously feels good to have a quarter with such a small number and to have put such large issues behind us; however, I want to remind you that we still expect legal expenses to be lumpy quarter over quarter for the next couple of years as we work through remaining issues. Now on page 12. We've covered most of the outlook as we went through the presentation, just a couple of additional things to cover. First, Mortgage Production. We told you to expect Mortgage Production to be negative for the year, we do, and we expect it to be negative for the second quarter. Obviously, the final result will be market dependent; however at this point, our outlook is for production pretax, excluding repurchase, to be a loss of between $100 million and $150 million, slightly improved from the first quarter on higher volumes seasonally. Second, on releases. Expect mortgage reserve releases to be more modest going forward, except for potentially PCI, purchase credit impaired loans, where we could see some lumpy releases if we have any, and expect card releases to be essentially over. So to wrap up, we feel good about the simplicity of the quarter and the solid core performance given challenging industry conditions. We are also pleased with the progress we've made on key items, including announcing the sale of our physical commodities business and our retirement planning services business, passing CCAR both qualitatively and quantitatively, exceeding 5% for the Firm and Bank leverage ratios, and maintaining strong expense discipline while investing in growth and control. And perhaps most importantly, continuing to deliver outstanding customer service and continuing to grow underlying performance drivers. With that, operator, you can open up the line please for Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Glenn.
MARIANNE LAKE: So hey, Glenn. Just so that I can give you the underlying core growth number, for the Firm for the quarter was 4% year on year, even though obviously if you take into consideration the run-off portfolios in Mortgage and Card we were closer to flat. In C&I, you're right. The industry was up slightly. We were not. It's a continuation of the things we've talked about, which is a combination of client selection, of being very disciplined on credit, so not chasing growth at the cost of liberal credit structures or overly aggressive pricing, and also the fact that we continued to see some of our criticized and classified loans be refinanced away from us. So we're just going to hold the line on discipline. We are seeing the ongoing aggressive competitive environment on both credit terms and pricing, and we'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do, but we're not going to chase growth at the expense of discipline.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so a higher quality portfolio, higher quality clients.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: So I think very broadly if you look at the numbers here we've pushed down our capital, leverage, SLR to all of the businesses so they're all making adjustments as appropriate. In the rates business in particular, you're seeing that there's very few what I call exotic rates products being done anymore, so that will be a rather large change. A lot of things going electronic, which can reduce your expenses too, so we're pretty comfortable our rates business will be normal profitability going forward. It may take a little bit of time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Glenn, I just want to make sure that it was clear in my remarks that the impact of the new proposal for leverage is included in the reported results.
JAMIE DIMON: A little bit, yes. But we all don't know what's going to happen to spreads going forward, so we're comfortable, we want to stay in the business, do a good job at it for our clients.
MARIANNE LAKE: So with LCR, whether you take the Basel or the US proposals, we're compliant at this point with the margin, and importantly we're also compliant with our own internal stress framework. So we feel good about LCR, we're continuing to manage it as you would expect. Yes, I am expecting us to get long-term debt rules this year, but I don't know when and I can't control it; we feel with over 19% available resources that we're in a good starting position, and so we're not really going to be in the business of guessing where that ends up. And we'll adjust accordingly if it's different from our expectations.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hello, Erika.
MARIANNE LAKE: So given that we did some restructuring of Bank level capital including some downstreaming, that was a fairly sizeable increase in the quarter, so you're not going to see progress be linear, but there are a number of different levers that we have in our toolkit so to speak to get to 6% over time, whether that's this year or whether that's into next year, we're going to be measured about the progress. So whether that's retaining earnings, potentially additional capital, we've been actioning leverage actions, both deposits as well as derivatives actions. And then ultimately there's also the [good guide] when it comes, timing dependent that may be a 2015 thing of hopefully moving from CEM to the newly named FACCR calculations for derivatives central future exposure. We did take a look at the information on FACCR and it hasn't changed our point of view that we would expect that to have a favorable impact for the Bank of 40 basis points plus or minus. So when that comes that will be a nice boost, but through retaining earnings and the leverage actions we have and potentially more capital optimization, we have a clear path to 6%, whether it's this year or early into 2015.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I would say it's fair to assume that our core margin should be relatively stable throughout the year, and I think plus or minus 2 basis points on a large balance sheet like ours with mix changes is relatively stable. So our expectation is for core NIM to be relatively stable in 2014, to be stable to slightly positive in 2015, assuming that the implied rate curve plays out the way it is.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's a combination of factors and we are seeing delinquency trends and roll rate charge-offs flatten out. We knew that it would happen one day. That's what we're seeing at the moment. We'll continue to update you through the course of the year; based upon that we're not expecting anymore results. In addition, you should know that -- you saw our outstandings were flat, and underneath that our core portfolio is growing; we still do believe we are at that inflection point and that we should see some growth, but it will be relatively modest.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, Erika.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you're talking about interchange fees in Card?
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so the sales volume obviously seasonally goes down quarter over quarter. I don't think that we have perceived there's been a significant impact from weather on Card sales in the first quarter; for us our sales were up 10% year on year, so pretty strong. No, I wouldn't attribute anything to the weather.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so you saw -- obviously you saw in the first quarter that on the back of lower revenues in the markets business, we have lower compensation as an absolute matter albeit that the ratio is relatively in line. So you're absolutely right depending upon how the rest of the year pans out will determine whether the compensation expenses inherent in our outlook for CIB are up or down or flat, and that will adjust our ending result. We're not ready yet to declare our position on the whole year, so less than $59 billion is still our guidance but we intend to be very, very disciplined.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so on the timing, I mentioned the fact that we aren't expecting our capital accretion to 10% plus to be linear, we're expecting it to be much more in the second half of the year, flatter in the first half, so it's reasonable to expect that we will be covering employee issuance plus or minus in the first half of the year with most of our repurchase capacity being available for us in the second half. As to how much of it we'll use will be dependent on a number of factors including obviously our share price at the time. But we do intend to take advantage of the opportunity that we have been given to buy back, and we'll see what the absolute level is when we get there.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's absolutely right, so when we declared at Investor Day that we had increased the target rate for that business, we pushed that down into the valuation of the asset one-time.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's three things. There's a little bit of timing in there insofar as we did make continued improvement in expenses and we're going to continue to work on what we would characterize as the sort of fixed cost base. It's definitely the case that we are building this business for the long run, and so we continue to invest in technology and operations to make us more profitable and efficient through the cycle. But it is also the case that it is an incredibly small market. I mean, the market size was sub $250 billion, so annualized sub $1 trillion, which is not something we've seen since before 2000. So the reality is in a market that size, it's very hard to have strong profitability or profitability when you have to have a core level of fixed expenses, and so we're thinking about this business over the longer run to be as efficient and profitable as possible through the cycle in markets that are on average bigger than this.
MARIANNE LAKE: So yes, I would say lower issuance was a factor but there were very many, so I wouldn't say that it was a single driving factor, lower mortgage issuance, lower debt issuance, a whole bunch of different things. And then as to catalysts, more volatility, more growth, and we'll just have to wait and see.
JAMIE DIMON: I think John we've always been very consistent on this kind of thing. You guys have got to make your own estimates because they are just as good as ours. Great business with great people, technology, sales, research, but we can't predict it going forward. It will be what it is.
MARIANNE LAKE: Similar to the mortgage comment where it's a long-term view, it affects the business and this is one quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we've accounted for it held for sale and no significant impacts to the results.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we obviously looked at the bid and the valuation and any of the difference versus book is in our P&L and it's insignificant, and we are engaged in ongoing relationship with the buyer, and we'll realize [that over] time. But it's not expected to be anything significant.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, it's fully phased in, it's our best effort of fully phased in, Betsy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct, but remember that with the exception of the fact that we aren't baking in things that are not yet certain, so we haven't baked in the benefit that we would expect, for example, from FACCR, because it hasn't yet been acknowledged.
MARIANNE LAKE: The sensitivity is different at the Bank and the Holding Company, so it's more like 30 plus or minus at the Holding Company, 40 plus or minus at the Bank.
MARIANNE LAKE: With respect to the headcount reduction in the first quarter, the severance wasn't significant and the benefit is largely in. Remember we said that overall the Firm is expecting to see headcount go down by about 5,000 for the full year and it's down only by 2,000, so far so we have another way to go.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well so if you think about it gross, mortgage was 6,000 of the total gross and it's 3,000 in, so another 3,000 to go I would say in the nearer not longer term. And in the Consumer Bank that was 2,000, with 1,500 in, the remainder will just happen through time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I'll give you the sort of very short qualitative answer, and then if you want to really dig in, I'd do it off line with Investor Relations. But the very short answer is there's an additional ability to recognize collateral and [netting], that wasn't in the original CEM calculation, there's lots and lots of other complexity to it. We are doing our best to estimate it. We haven't fully built the models to do it, so we're continuing to work on that, but if you want to get into a very technical discussion on it we can arrange that for you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, so a couple of things. First is that if you remember from Investor Day, notwithstanding the earlier comment about the volatility potentially in compensation in the Markets businesses, we said we would be below $59 billion, and there were four principal things driving that. So in our favor we have efficiencies in branches, efficiencies in CIB, and mainly mortgage down about $1.5 billion year over year. And against us we had the $1 billion incremental cost of control and some growth principally in asset management, so the net of all of those meant that we were effectively self-funding through efficiency and reduced mortgage expenses, the incremental cost and controls that you're seeing come through. It isn't the case that we have broken out as a macro matter how much of that $1 billion is in our run rate now, and maybe we'll do that for you next quarter. I would say that we are adding heads and so these things do take some time; even though I believe that there will be a chunk of it in our run rate through the middle of the year, it's not all in our run rate yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well I'll have to confirm to you next quarter, but I would say that we would have a majority of it in through the midyear because we are obviously trying to hire up to be able to execute on the agenda. So if you think about the impact we're trying to add people to compliance, we are adding people to compliance, to legal, to audit, to finance, to risk, and we're doing that largely in the first half of the year, but there will be a tail.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so I mean, it's very -- as you know it's very, very difficult to decouple everything but and so it's not clear that there's no impact, but it's not our sense that it was a significant driver of the performance in the quarter, and there is a limited amount of volume on SEF right now, albeit increasing, and there's been margin compression, but from tight margins to start with. So it's not our sense that it was a significant driver, not to say that there was no impact.
JAMIE DIMON: So it did come down a little bit but it's kind of back to where it was, the derivative trading, and we wouldn't blame that for anything.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right. So I mean again, not to say there hasn't been any but the volumes are relatively low, the margins are relatively tight, the $1 billion we talked about which is by the way our best estimate, so it could be better than that, is something that would progress through time, it's not going to be a cliff.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the best guidance that I could give you is the guidance that we gave at Investor Day, which is expect the Firm-wide charge-offs to be at around $5 billion plus or minus, and then I would point you to the guidance we just gave you on reserve releases, which is expect some more in mortgage but modest, expect we might have some in PCI but it's too early to know, and that little more in Card, so net those two down.
MARIANNE LAKE: And there may be some noise to that, but that's our current best outlook.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, largely speaking. That seems about right, 10%, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So our production revenues this quarter, just to make sure we're talking about the same thing, was just about $300 million. I told you that we're expecting the second quarter to be negative, you're going to have higher revenues because seasonally you have higher volumes, but obviously it's market dependent. So I would say given seasonality, the first quarter was small and volumes were depressed given the weather, we would be hopeful that the market would be above $1 trillion for the full year, maybe not quite as high as $1.2 trillion, so if you add seasonality back in and gross up the number, you could probably get quite close. But of course it could all change depending upon rates in the market.
MARIANNE LAKE: The current outlook for the market size was about $1.2 trillion. I suspect that will be revised down slightly on the back of the first quarter, so we're going to have a small market. It won't be absolutely linear.
MARIANNE LAKE: Year-over-year revenues for asset management, institutional, no specific. We had some -March was not strong, the first quarter for institutional was not as strong as the other segments, so no specific issues but there's some lumpiness there obviously.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, the securities, that line item is a funky feature of the fact that in our prime services business, when we -- our contractual income is LIBOR minus the spread which drives that to be a negative number; I wouldn't read too much into the trend and volatility there. The absolute economics of the business is still positive and the offset is in trading liability, so that's not a line item in its own right and alone that is very constructive.
MARIANNE LAKE: Reserve releases.
MARIANNE LAKE: And then we don't drill into every $50 million negative non-recurring item but there was some of them too.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, it's not far off the 30% plus or minus, which is our generally expected effective tax rate. Nothing else of any noteworthiness. I mean obviously it's always going to be impacted by the absolute level of pretax, the percentage of overseas income, the percentage of tax efficient income, but nothing special.
MARIANNE LAKE: We haven't really changed our guidance, to be fair our guidance was always to be negative for the year. We're just trying to be very specific about the degree of negative in the second quarter to make sure you have information for your models.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: So obviously the timing of sales is going to be a little bit opportunistic, so the best comment I can make is that $600 million number is two, three years away from now, not necessarily but we'll try and manage it the best way we can. And then with respect to the ability to sell sub service, there is still the opportunity to do it. It's just not necessarily the case that you can defease your risk entirely, which I think is understood.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well I mean, insofar as I think that as we move loans to sub services, obviously we retain the risks and have to have third-party oversight. To the degree we sell them, I think the regulators are potentially looking at originators to continue to bear some of the origination and other risks.
JAMIE DIMON: We're going to run the MSR for returns and quality, so it's also a question of what you put into it so you should probably expect to see less FHA and things like that, and then you'll see some run-off over time.
JAMIE DIMON: It's almost impossible to tell, but there are -- if you're jumbo you can get loans, if you are GSE you can get loans, but almost all the other stuff in between, anything with any hair on it like if you ever had a credit problem, if you are earning self-reported income, so a lot of people have overlay, they're being tougher than is required by FHA, GSE, or their own rules because of reps and warranties, et cetera. And I don't know when that's going to go away. It's not getting worse. It's just sitting there and probably holding back a little bit the purchase market.
MARIANNE LAKE: Think about the credit is available across the LTV spectrum, but the bar to be able to document income and prove ability to repay under QM is high.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the models that were disapproved we understood that we were going to have certain of our models that needed additional work to be acceptable by the regulators of Basel III when we gave the guidance at Investor Day, so as a large matter as we sit here today, that's still our best understanding of how things will work out absent there being any new news or issues during the year.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a timing difference as opposed to a target difference.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, the whole industry submitted a huge number of models under Basel 2.5 to the regulators to review at the beginning of 2013. We had an approval to use them for the year while they were being reviewed and pending after the review; we got some feedback and we're going to remediate the models and resubmit them for approval. So it will take us time but it is timing.
JAMIE DIMON: Just assume it's going to be fairly constant.
JAMIE DIMON: When we know what the real rules are we may modify that.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right. We're not managing to an OLA that we don't know yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Well we told you we are firmly supportive of having proper and good markets for everybody, and we think we have pretty good policies and protocols in place. But I don't know what it will do to other -- there are issues in market structures with some pools et cetera, but we just have to let that review take place. I should point out in Michael Lewis' book which I did not read on page 231, they refer to us as one of the good guys.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: So a couple of things. As you know, we have been investing and building our branch to the place it is now where we're happy with the distribution capability we have, so that was driving a lot of the investment. In 2014 we continue to invest in [quarterly] and digital and the cost to serve and efficiency so that we can drive the ratios down. We guided at Investor Day to expect expenses in the business to be up 1%, so a little but not the kind of increase that we've been seeing after which you should expect it to start to come down. And we said that the overall CCB business including mortgage would be down $2 billion by 2016 over 2014, and a chunk of that is in CBD. So we are very focused on it and investing in fact in the technology and processes to be able to be efficient; we started to see the increased turn as we stopped having to invest in branches because we're happy with the distribution and it will start to come down next year.
MARIANNE LAKE: So everything that I talked about in terms of expenses going down is all on a dollar basis, not an efficiency ratio basis, so we're absolutely expecting dollars to come down after 2014 in the business. With respect to the new branches, I mean we said like there's a third of our branches that are less than 10 years old, and about 11% less than 3 years old, so we have a lot of branches in the deposit gathering phase. And deposit margins are relatively flat, so at the moment we've reached the point where volume is out, is providing support to NII, but not strong growth until we start to see rates continue to rise and be able to reinvest up the curve as deposits investments mature.
JAMIE DIMON: The underlying numbers are terrific, customer satisfaction, deposits, households, mobile, Chase Wealth Management, small business, et cetera, but they are being squeezed by NII and interest rates and we've always told you we're going to build for the long run, which is that will recover one day and you will see spreads go up in this business. And when that happens it happens, but we're not going to not grow deposits because of that. And that will also affect obviously efficiency ratio.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so as much as I would love to be able to take a quarter that looks like this and say we could expect more of the same, the reality is we still have issues open in front of us. We still have large reserves and we still are working through them. So we've been clear that while we can't predict legal expenses, we do expect them to be lumpy, and for every zero or close to zero quarter, we could have a quarter that has several hundred millions of dollars or more, albeit that it should trend down and abate to something much lower over time. So I don't think you can read into it that we're done, we're still working through issues, we're obviously glad to have some of them behind us and some of the bigger and most difficult ones.
JAMIE DIMON: No. If you look at the customer flows, in every single business they are very good, and customer sat scores are up, investments are up, assets under management are up, market shares are up, credit card, consumer, deposits, that's all very good. So I would completely separate out this litigation stuff, and Marianne, you all have averaged your own estimates for litigation I think are $500 million a quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: By our quarterly models, it's about $500 million a quarter, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: So make believe, I'm going to use your number, nobody else's, it's not going to be $500 million consistent. It's going to be zero, something else, zero to $50 million, that's what it is until it goes away. It's not going to affect the underlying business. And as you know we're also going to have one-time benefits from stuff we don't anticipate too.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're growing share so-JAMIE DIMON: Clients go with their feet and they seem to be coming to our branches and our bankers.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's a little bit of we don't know where capital markets revenues will go obviously, and if they stay low or we expect to pass that down to the bottom line, it's also a little bit of there are sometimes positive and sometimes negative surprises and issues in expenses at this time every quarter, so there's a little bit of cautiousness in there. We're going to obviously do everything we can to outperform that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So most of the improvement in this quarter was associated with the ability for us to net variation margin on derivatives across currencies as allowed by contracts rather than having to only net in the currency of the underlying transaction. So that was obviously sensible that you should be allowed to net margin across allowable currencies, but that was not the provision of the Basel committee; the US proposal changed that and that's favorable. That's driving most of it, there were other things up, down, complicated technical things, but not big numbers.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's correct but I'm not expecting that in the very near future.
JAMIE DIMON: We're going to have to get back to you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Chris I'll get back to you. I apologize. We'll get back to you.
JAMIE DIMON: Probably has to do with [awards], but we'll get back to you.
JAMIE DIMON: So there are certain things which are secular. People who have gotten out of it -- I'm not talking about us per se, but people have gotten out of reduced dramatically credit hybrids, certain exotic derivatives et cetera, and I think there may be additional secular change. But it's not the whole business, so the way I look at the whole business is we have 120 trading desks around the world, we have 16,000 clients. And if you look at the fuel of the business, the fuel of the business is investable assets in need of people to invest those, whether it's corporations, individual, et cetera. Those numbers will double over 10 years, they're going to triple in the emerging and developing markets. And spreads themselves have been coming down fairly consistently for 20 years, and that's called capitalism, that you're efficiently using capital. So I look at it as a long-term business, it will be a good business, shares are going to change, there will be a whole bunch of adjustments. And as you know, it can change on a dime, and so we're not, I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup. I think it's pretty good business, and we have had very consistent performance. Remember it's driven by technology, research, sales, ideas, of course border flows, and last year we didn't even have one trading day loss, which I consider really spectacular. So it's a good business. It will grow over time and it will have some secular adjustments. And I don't know about your numbers being right, the 13 of 17 quarters. And I also wouldn't go back and look at the peak, the really peak markets of 2007 or something and I think you had some of that in 2009 and say that was a standard. I think that was a little high. Higher than normal.
MARIANNE LAKE: I have an answer to your other question, I apologize for not having it off the top of my head. In the first quarter of last year, in non-interest revenue in Card we had a one-time exit of a non-core product. So I think if you go back and dig out that transcript or have a look at the supplement there, there was actually a one-time item, so if we adjust for that, we would have been up more strongly.
JAMIE DIMON: I might mention on the credit card business we have beta tests going of our Chase net and you're not going to see it in the numbers this year, but we think it's a pretty exciting thing that we can do for merchants and customers over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks for joining us.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",-0.1299999999999999,0.4690000000000005,1,0.09699450576980338,0.11064027393846683
30,Q1_2015,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. So starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $5.9 billion for the quarter and EPS of $1.45 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 14%. On revenue of nearly $25 billion, up 4% year on year reflecting strong performance. The quarter was characterized by a constructive environment supporting broad strength in underlying performance. We saw higher levels of volatility and client activity on the back of a number of macro events driving higher markets revenues. We also saw strength across IBCs and core loan growth was strong up 10% year on year. Included in the results was firm-wide legal expense of approximately $500 million after-tax. Outside of legal other small and notable items on a net basis did not contribute significantly to the result which means that a more core earnings number would have been well the other side of $6 billion. Adjusted expense which excludes legal was $14.2 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 57%. And outside of a modest reserve bill for oil and gas which I will come back to credit trends remained benign and firm-wide net charge-offs remained low at $1.1 billion. We continued to make progress against our capital targets reaching a fully phased in CET1 ratio of 10.6% while returning over $3 billion to shareholders in the quarter. Finally we're pleased that we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the Board announced its intention to increase the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.44 a share and authorized gross share repurchases of $6.4 billion. Before I move on you will notice we streamlined our earnings press release for the quarter, simplified the format and focused in on key messages. Skipping over page 2, turning to page 3 and our balance sheet. As I said the firm's fully phased in CET1 ratio advanced with 10.6% up about 45 basis points quarter on quarter with earnings, model benefit and the combined impact of portfolio runoff and other RWA reductions being offset by capital distributions. The fully phased in standardized CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up from 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. While we made very good progress during the first quarter the pace of capital accretion during the year won't be linear particularly given the timing of model benefit. We continue to expect our ratio to be 11% plus or minus at the end of this year. The firm and the bank SLR improved slightly from last quarter at 5.7% and 6% respectively. On the next page on page 4, we've added a new page on our balance sheet given the objectives we outlined at Investor Day on nonoperating deposits. So turn to page 4. As you look at the balance sheet it's important to look both on an average and on a spot basis. If you look on the left our average balance sheet is higher by $46 billion which reflects a significant ramp up in deposits in the fourth quarter. But if you look next to that you can see on a spot basis that March is actually relatively flat to December. And if you move to the right end of the period deposits are also flat quarter on quarter but with a relatively significant mix shift towards retail deposits. With other deposits down $24 billion predominantly driven by client actions related to nonoperating deposits reflecting good progress towards our goal in what has effectively been a matter of weeks since Investor Day. We're actively engaged with our clients and working with them to implement plans to further reduce these deposits and we expect the second quarter to be meaningful in this context. We're still committed to our goal of reducing them by up to $100 billion by the end of the year. Moving on to NIM and NII it's the higher average cash balances on deposit growth as well as some asset reductions that drove the 7 basis point compression in NIM. And in terms of NII day count was a large driver of the decline. Turning to page 5 and Consumer & Community Banking, the combined Consumer businesses generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $10.7 billion was up 2% year on year driven by healthy growth in balances and in noninterest revenue partially offset by spread compression. Revenue declined 2% sequentially reported or 4% if you were to exclude the loss in the fourth quarter associated with portfolio exits in Card. And this decline is driven by seasonality in NIR as well as fewer days in the quarter. We remain focused on the customer experience and on our strong customer satisfaction rankings and we continue to grow households and see very low levels of attrition. And we're deepening relationships. Our average deposits are now over $0.5 trillion, up 9% year on year. We have record client investment assets up 12%. Our active mobile customer base is a 22%, Card sales volume up 8% and our overall loan book grew for the third consecutive quarter with core loan growth of 15% year on year. And across CCB we remain disciplined on expense management. Year-on-year expenses were lower by nearly $250 million and our headcount is down about 1,900 so far this year. You will recall that at Investor Day we committed to reduce expenses by about $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014. And while it will not be exactly linear you should assume a meaningful down payment towards that $2 billion in 2015. Moving to page 6 Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $828 million for the quarter up 10% year on year and with an ROE of 28%. We continue to see robust performance across our drivers. Average deposit balance growth was up 9%, up $39 billion from last year and in Business Banking the momentum we saw in 2014 carried over into 2015 and supported loan originations of $1.5 billion, up 2% year on year but with average loan balances up 6% also driven by higher utilization rates. These underlying drivers helped offset the impact of the low rate environment. NII was down 5% quarter over quarter in line with our guidance on lower deposit margin which was down 12 basis points driven by lower reinvestment rates as well as day count. NIR while down seasonally quarter on quarter was up 5% year on year due to strong client investment and debit revenues. Expenses were down 3% year on year reflecting continued improvement in branch efficiency. Mortgage Banking on page 7, you'll notice we simplified the reporting for Mortgage Banking here; it's now consistent with the other CCB lines of business. But the additional detail by sub line of business is still available in our earnings supplement. So overall net income was $326 million for the quarter, originations were strong at $25 billion up 7% quarter over quarter as we maintain share in a larger market and realized higher revenue margins. And we added $15 billion of high-quality loans in the quarter to our balance sheet driving slightly higher NII quarter on quarter despite fewer days. Although production was higher our total revenue declined quarter over quarter on lower repurchase benefits and lower servicing revenue. Expense of $1.2 billion was down 6% quarter over quarter and down 13% year on year but excluding legal would have been down 19% year on year, over $0.25 billion despite higher volumes as we continue to tightly control our costs. On credit we continued to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and released $100 million of NCI reserves this quarter. And you can see the net charge-off rate at 30 basis points was down 25 basis points year on year. Moving on to Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net income of $1.1 billion down 3% year on year with an ROE of 22% but excluding reserve releases net income was up 11%. In the quarter we moved our commercial card loans to the CIB to align with the client relationships. This was a $1.3 billion reduction in Card loan balances and relatively modest impact of less than $50 million on each of revenue and expense. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year on year with the Card revenue rate of 12.2% in line with guidance. On solid sales growth and reflecting continued investment in acquisitions. And in Auto we saw solid loan and lease growth partially offset by spread compression. Expense was up 2% year on year predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation. In Card we saw end-of-period loan growth of $3 billion excluding the commercial card transfer I just mentioned and we saw sales growth of 8%. This sales growth is lower than recent growth rates which have typically been in the double digits reflecting the impact of lower gas prices estimated to be about 200 basis points as well as a generally competitive environment. In Commerce Solutions we're gaining share; volume was up 13% year on year, driven by continued strong spend as well as the addition of new merchants. And in Auto results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used-car values. It was the 14th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 6% year on year. Year to date the pipeline remains healthy reflecting continued strength in the market as well as the strength of our manufacturing partners. Finally on credit, card delinquency rates and net charge-offs remained low. On page 9 the Corporate & Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.6 billion and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 8% year on year as market conditions in the quarter benefited both investment banking and markets and our businesses performed well. In banking our IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 22% year on year. We continue to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.6% share up 100 basis points since last year. Advisory fees were up 42% which was a strong start for both JPMorgan as well as the market with some large transactions. In fact this was our highest first quarter on record and we saw share gains of 150 basis points. Debt underwriting fees were up 16% driven by acquisition financing. Aside from that debt issuance was generally lower and equity underwriting fees were up 13% in a market that was up only 4%. Our wallet rank improved to number one both globally and in the US. Looking forward for IB fees we had some notable large transactions in the first quarter and so we do expect the second quarter to be lower although our pipeline remains strong. Treasury services revenue of $1 billion was down 2% year on year mainly driven by lower deposit NII and lower trade finance revenue. And lending revenue was $353 million, up 9% given dividends on restructured securities. Moving on to markets revenue of $5.7 billion it was up 9% year on year but if you exclude business simplification both total markets as well as fixed income markets would have been up 20%. A number of macro events occurred in the quarter including Central Bank actions, the Swiss franc decoupling, a stronger dollar and oil price volatility which supported markets performance broadly in currencies, emerging markets, rates, commodities and equities. In fact equities had one of its strongest quarters up 22% with strength in derivatives and cash in particular across the US and Asia. The first half of the quarter was particularly strong. The market has absorbed a number of the macro events at this point and recent sentiment is that the Fed will act later rather than sooner this year. As a result while we are still seeing good client flow and volatility does remain elevated it is somewhat lower coming into the second quarter. With respect to business simplification in the second quarter it will happen overall neutral impact to our P&L but will have or drive a $300 million decline year on year in revenue with a $300 million offset in lower expenses. Security services revenue $934 million was down 9% year on year driven by two factors. First the impact of change in presentation for client revenue sharing agreements in our ADR issuance business. Effective this quarter these past few payments to clients will be treated as a reduction of revenue having formerly been treated as an expense but with no P&L impact. Second at the end of the fourth quarter of last year there was a significant client exit and the revenue impact of this is reflected in this quarter's results. So for the remainder of 2015 given those two facts we expect security services revenue to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion a quarter depending on seasonality. Lastly on expense total expense was $5.7 billion up 1% year on year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter flat year on year and an overhead ratio of $0.59. Non-compensation expense declined due to business simplification partially offset by higher legal expense year on year. Moving on to page 10 and the Commercial Bank, it was a strong quarter with respect to the underlying fundamentals in this business, another record quarter for investment banking revenue with gross revenues of over $750 million. In absolute dollars it was our strongest quarter ever for loan growth adding over $5 billion in loans across C&I and CRE and revolver utilization was at its highest level since 2009. Credit quality remained exceptional with continued loan net charge-offs of only 3 basis points. So overall financial performance for the quarter was solid. Net income was $600 million on $1.7 billion of revenue and an ROE of 17%. Revenue increased 4% year on year driven by record investment banking revenue which was up nearly 70%. On increased equity underwriting and M&A activity was partially offset by continued yield compression. Expenses increased 3% year on year as we continued to invest in controls but our overhead ratio is consistent with the prior year. We're reaching a peak in control cost in this business and you should expect expenses to stabilize from here. Loan balances increased 11% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. C&I loans grew 4% sequentially in line with the industry driven by higher utilization in our corporate client banking book. And in CRE loan growth was 3% continuing to exceed the industry on strong activity in both multifamily lending as well as real estate banking. Finally on credit and reserve for the full firm we added a little over $100 million to reserves relating to oil and gas exposure this quarter, the majority of which is here in the Commercial Bank. We review our energy exposure on a name-by-name basis and under a range of commodity price assumptions. This quarter's reserve build reflects downgrades in the E&P portfolio and if the current price environment continues it's reasonable to expect some further reserve builds during 2015 but relatively modest. However, in the context of a funded portfolio of $15 billion this is a very modest build and is fully within the range of our expectations at this part of the cycle for energy. And although we're taking reserve it is not clear that they will translate into credit losses as the industry and our clients are not standing still but actively working to manage liquidity and leverage in the face of lower prices. Moving to page 11 and Asset Management a good quarter in Asset Management, net income of $500 million and ROE of 22% and 27% pretax margin on $3 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 7% year on year driven by flows and higher banking balances and expense of $2.2 billion was up 5% year on year primarily driven by investments in infrastructure and controls and including modest legal expenses. This marks the 24th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows at $16 billion driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion up 7% year on year and client assets of $2.4 trillion, the strength in multi-asset and equity flows. In banking we reported strong balances in both lending and deposits, average loan balances were up 8% year on year and average deposits up 6%. And we reported strong investment performance with 79% of mutual fund AUMs ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Turning to Corporate and turning to page 12 Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $221 million but the results included a loss in the quarter of $173 million pretax primarily due to a timing impact of cost associated with certain nonoperating deposits we plan to exit. On other corporate as we've completed the spinoff of OEP and other portfolio sales during the first quarter the remaining private equity business is not expected to be a significant contributor to the firm's earnings. Therefore, beginning this quarter and going forward we will be disclosing our corporate private equity results as part of other corporate. This quarter private equity contributed a modest positive to the results. Also included in the results of other corporate were $300 million pretax of legal expense which is largely offset by $177 million of net income from tax items. Moving to page 13 and the outlook, I addressed most of this guidance through the presentation. I just want to highlight a couple of items. First in CCB, in the Consumer businesses, a couple of geography points relative to analyst models. We guided in the fourth quarter to expect the first quarter's Consumer Bank revenues to be down on deposit margin compression. We saw that this quarter as expected and we expect deposit margins to remain pressured as rates remain low. In the mortgage bank at Investor Day we guided for revenues to be down approximately $1 billion for the year on lower servicing revenues as well as lower repurchase benefit. We saw some of that this quarter and that guidance remains. Against that as I said earlier across CCB we do expect to deliver a meaningful portion of the $2 billion expense reduction guidance in 2015. Finally on this page on Asset Management for the full-year expect the pretax margin in ROE to be at the low end of the through the cycle target range. So wrapping up a strong result for the quarter in a constructive environment. We saw strong market and transaction activity despite continued margin compression. The performance continues to reflect the strength of each of our franchises, strong markets revenue and IB fees, 9% growth in retail deposits, 10% core loan growth and good progress against our capital, our balance sheet and our expense commitment. With that, operator, please can you open up the line to questions. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: There wasn't anything particularly noteworthy in terms of one-time events. It was really quite broad particularly in derivatives. In cash the performance was I would say solid year over year because we saw strength in the Americas this year but we had strength in Europe last year. And I think the first-quarter 2014 wasn't particularly strong, so I think we were flatter a little bit with a relative comparison but it was a really strong absolute and we think probably strong relative performance.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, this is where it would be. I wouldn't say it's a driver, but we are as you said and the whole industry is looking to work with clients to optimize the use of the balance sheet and improve returns. So we've seen some of that. But I wouldn't say it was a key driver.
MARIANNE LAKE: It is more of the same. Obviously G-SIB took on a slightly heightened focus when we had some doubling happen in the proposal in December. So we've always been measuring and monitoring and tracking G-SIB at a very granular level. But we are obviously on a path now to aggressively manage it which means that we are going to be just a little bit more focused on that constraint, not uniquely also with advanced capital, standardized limits, balance sheet caps, the like. So it's more of the same, honestly, than just a heightened focus on this given the US proposal and given the impact of at least at this point FX translations.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: And different than RWA it affects certain products more than others. And we pointed out nonoperating deposits, stuff like that. Certain businesses more than others we've pointed out clearing and certain clients more than others we've pointed out financial institutions. So it's just kind of a multi-variant theme. It's not mystical and we're actually already starting to reprice some of these businesses to get an adequate return on G-SIB capital. And we're seeing other people do that too.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right. We may be in a different position with G-SIB but others are leverage constrained. And just generally speaking we are starting to see a lot more discipline around balance sheet and pricing is following somewhat generally.
MARIANNE LAKE: We can put Mike back in the queue later.
MARIANNE LAKE: So again assuming for a second that rates don't rise until the backend if not the end of the year and we can come back to that if you like we would expect our NII dollars to be stable to slightly up because we're still seeing growth in our interest-earning assets. Obviously this quarter we were down some on day count, it was a big chunk of the quarter-on-quarter reduction. So we're really going to see the biggest lift in NII when we do see interest rates rise and we'll see when that is. And similarly on our NIM we would expect NIM to be stable particularly given as we talked about what we've seen dilute our NIM more particularly over the course of the last year or two has been this significant increase in cash and we're going to see some of that at least stabilize and turn as we start to reduce nonoperating deposits. So we should see our NIM relatively stable and again start to rise when rates rise.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay, so taking your first point, Erika, obviously I don't know the next time we're going to in all likelihood get CCAR instructions including the rules and the minimums is likely to be some time towards the end of this year for the next CCAR cycle as we get prepared to deliver that. So all I can say is what you know which is clearly the door was left open for the minimum to be increased or potentially to include some element of the surcharge. We're hopeful that that won't be the case because we would say the surcharge should be carried in baseline times to be used in stress and to have all firms end up well-capitalized afterwards. But I have no more insight than that for you. With respect to the dialogue with the Fed look, it's definitely much, much further progressed than it was two years and three years ago and every year it gets better in terms of the bilateral conversations and it's constructive. I don't think, however, you could today or will likely ever be able to characterize it as transparent and clear, maybe potentially by design in terms of understanding or being able to reconcile exactly what their models do and what their results are driven by. So I won't be able to clarify for you what changed in their results or what differs between ours and theirs but the dialogue itself is definitely more constructive and more bilateral and more continuous.
MARIANNE LAKE: Look, I think that the best way to answer that is that we are still firmly with our guidance of adjusted expenses being $57 billion plus or minus by the end of the year or for the year, sorry. Obviously we will always try and outperform that but I wouldn't characterize one quarter as a change in that guidance at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: So look the most important thing obviously in all of that is that we were delighted to be able to partner with the large company on their strategic transformation and that's the most important thing about that transaction for us. I'm not going to comment specifically on whether or what JPMorgan would be interested in in terms of asset purchases. We're much more focused on partnering strategically with the company.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, we haven't given any specific guidance, Chris.
MARIANNE LAKE: In the context of the CCAR we just had?
MARIANNE LAKE: We expect our -- it's a little complicated this year and we sort of articulated it at Investor Day because we're going to move at some point whether it's the third of the fourth quarter to have standardized RWA be our binding constraint. So 11% plus or minus is our target on CET1 and that's all we've said.
MARIANNE LAKE: There's a couple of different things. One was a little specific. We had a portfolio of loans that we held for sale and have subsequently exited from the balance sheet which drives some of it. But in addition just generally a competitive environment and lower demand particularly in Asia.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not specifically, no. I will tell you that while we are obviously delighted with the performance it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions so we're happy with the gains. I can't specifically comment on where it came from.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's definitely more the latter. So basically if you think about our E&P portfolio in particular when we think about the redetermination somewhat semiannually of the borrowing base and looked at those companies on a client-specific name by name basis there was some contraction in the borrowing base and therefore some downgrades that drive our reserving methodology. It doesn't mean that we feel that those companies are necessarily in significant difficulty but that's the way the reserving methodology works. And as I said we do this on a client by client basis, we're comfortable with our exposures and clients are looking to manage their own defensive position. So it's not clear that they will necessarily be realized in losses; in fact, if the implied curve rather than flat to long oil prices is in fact how things play out it's possible that there will be very little in the way of credit loss we'd experience.
MARIANNE LAKE: Both. Both.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so first of all just on the contraction in spend driven by oil prices it's pretty typical in this part of the cycle that you would see lower energy prices in the first instance drive savings rates up and you see consumer spend for the energy dividend so to speak lag back. So the fact that we saw that happen in the first quarter is not atypical and it doesn't mean that we don't expect the spend to grow and for that energy dividend to ultimately translate into higher spend going forward. So it's more of a normal timing phenomenon is our expectation but with respect to other activity, yes we saw active equity capital markets with some defensive issuance and generally I think it's a positive overall for the businesses and for the economy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not readily but we can get back to you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, nothing specific to call out in the second half of the year. And we should hit 11% if not a little better, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Look, I would say seven weeks or six weeks or whatever it is after Investor Day that the messaging hasn't really changed which is we have every intention of aggressively managing the score, doing it as we talked about earlier in a very granular way. And we're already working on that and you see that in the most obvious place which is in the reduction already to date in nonoperating deposits. But we continue to work on all of the things so derivative notional compression, level III assets, financing, obviously we're still thinking about what the response should be in terms of risk intermediation and clearing. And so I think six weeks on from Investor Day the story is the same, we feel we are fully committed to ensuring that we are safely within the 4.5% bucket and we may not stop there but we're only a few months into this.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I was obviously you noted it from a small base so that's notable. There are two specific transactions or two specific exposures that were moved to nonaccrual. One of them was moved on a somewhat of a technicality, a sovereign downgrade which we fully expect to recover on. But that is just the way we have to present it and the other smaller piece was one other isolated exposure. So I wouldn't overthink it right now. It's two exposures and it's $200 million in total.
MARIANNE LAKE: The first the sovereign downgrade was did have oil and gas underlying exposure but again it was on a technicality rather than on the fundamentals of the Company. And we fully expect to recover on that.
JAMIE DIMON: Focus on the very, very small number.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, I would just say that overall our sense is that the market is neutral relative to the event. We happen to be able to benefit a little from it. Some others will be more neutral and some may have lost. As these happen regular way in trading businesses and it just happens to be the case that that event and the volatility it drove is good for our client franchise. And I think it really just goes to show you that we're in a business where expertise matters and risk discipline matters and we were able to capitalize on both of those not just for the Swiss franc but also for the other macro events in the quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, I wouldn't even characterize them as one-time gains. I would characterize them as one of a number of items that drove our performance in the business.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so overall the total firm the reserve build that we took was a little over $100 billion, 4/5 of which was in the Commercial Bank. So we did experience -- we do all of this on a name-by-name basis, so we did it across our portfolios but the majority was in the CB E&P portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: It was $100 billion.
MARIANNE LAKE: $100 billion.
MARIANNE LAKE: No worries. $100 billion, I mean look at the end of the day you can see that over the course of the last since whatever the third quarter of 2012 our cash balances grew by a couple hundred billion dollars and that has been a very large contributor to the compression in our NIM, not the only one. So as we push out the nonoperating deposits we would expect to see that help but remember we're still growing retail deposits. So if you look at this quarter in particular even though we reduced our nonop deposits related to client actions by about $20 billion, the majority of that $24 billion, we have flat deposits so we're continuing to grow the good retail deposits. So I would say it would be a tailwind but it would be a tailwind to a stabilizing and slightly improving NIM outside of rate rises.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, I'm sorry of the top of my head can't remember the number you're saying. But no, our legal expenses, forget the legal expense that relates to reserves that we've taken and settlements that we reached, our regular way expense for third parties in legal isn't down substantially quarter on quarter or year on year at this point, although at some point it will be.
MARIANNE LAKE: So specifically with respect to the quarter I would say that the wholesale parameter update -wholesale credit parameter updates model benefits is about half of the RWA reduction with the other half coming from regular way portfolio run off as well as some reductions in market risk associated with market risk positions, reductions in private equity, reductions in commitment. So some position reductions rather than driven specifically by FX. Look, we're running above $1.5 trillion now and we said we're going to manage both the advance and standardize to that number over the course of the next couple of years. So if FX or if the currency translation is a tailwind then we would hope to do better but at this point let's get there.
MARIANNE LAKE: So at the moment our CET1 ratio launching into CCAR was below 10%, not the 12% that we expect to run at once we have built our capital to our target level. And so you are right that right now under CCAR Tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint both last year and this year. And so a combination of our capital strategy around how we think about the issuance of preferred together with balance sheet actions will be how we think about mitigating that limitation in the short to medium term. But ultimately it doesn't change the fact that once we get to our target assuming that is the 12% that we articulated at Investor Day that again we don't think we should be leverage constrained, so yes we're going to work on that obviously and we are continuing to build capital but when we launched into CCAR we weren't at that level.
JAMIE DIMON: To give you a little perspective I also spoke in that the banking system is much stronger to start with and every bank in the system is much stronger. So just trying to think through what are the effects of some of these things and we look at it is kind of a warning shot across the bow. What I worry about more is what happens in a stress environment and I think people are paying attention to what's going on in the markets and if there has to be changes down the road there might be some changes that are relevant to that.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think the best way to think about it is through the cycle target that Doug Petno put out at Investor Day which is 18%. So that doesn't mean to say that we will benefit when rates rise in this business and it is very competitive and spreads are compressing and there's a lot of factors going on but through the cycle 18% so we're some years below and some above. Just the question on core growth and security services outside of presentation changes and client exits is currently in the low single digits. So obviously a little bit muted because we're working on the balance sheet optimization but certainly growing and in the low single digits and in terms of looking at advisory and who we are gaining share from principally European banks. Okay, no more questions?
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks everybody.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",0.06000000000000005,-0.4059999999999988,0,0.0865835757272765,0.09237440962071966
31,Q1_2013,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. So if you turn to page 1, a very strong start to the year with record net income of $6.5 billion for the first quarter and record EPS of $1.59 a share. On revenue of $25.8 billion, and a return on tangible common equity of 17% for the quarter. You can see on page 1 we've highlighted up front two significant items. A $650 million reserve release in mortgage and a $500 million reserve release in card. And as I go through the presentation, I'll also be highlighting for you a number of smaller items, some positive and some negative. We continue to maintain the leadership positions we highlighted at Investor Day. Number one ATM network. Number two branch network. Number two mortgage originator. Number one credit card issuer in the US. And number one ranking in global IB fees. And we're on track to deliver against our expense targets for the year. On a reported basis, total loans for the Company were up 1%, with core loan growth, excluding run-off, up 5%. Favorable credit performance continued in our wholesale and core consumer portfolios, with low levels of delinquencies and charge-offs. As the housing market recovers, losses in the real estate portfolio continue to improve. And this quarter we saw 30 plus delinquencies decline by 14% and severities improve. If you turn to page 3 for a brief capital update. We ended the quarter with Basel I and Basel III Tier One common of $143 billion, and $146 billion, respectively. Both up from last quarter. Our Basel I ratio is 10.2%, which reflects the impact of new market risk rules that went into effect in January. And the 10.2% compares to a ratio of 9.9% for last quarter as measured on the same basis. Our Basel III ratio of 8.9% is up from 8.7% last quarter and reflects the full impact of the rules as we understand them. And, as you know, we don't pull forward the impact of passive run-off or [mode] enhancements, which we expect to deliver around 100 basis points of benefit this year and next. And we still expect to reach our Basel III Tier 1 common target of 9.5% by the end of this year, including the capacity to continue share repurchases. As we've also made progress this quarter and are on track for full LCR compliance this year. In the bullet at the bottom of the page, the Board intends to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share effective in the second quarter. And we repurchased $2.6 billion of common equity in the first quarter, with authorization to repurchase an additional $6 billion over the next four quarters. Turning to the businesses. On page 4 we have Consumer- Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.6 billion of revenue. With an ROE of 23% on new allocated capital. And as we go through the presentation, all of the current quarter ROEs are calculated based upon the new allocated capital numbers that we showed you at Investor Day. Overall, revenue was down year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by Mortgage Banking. Quarter on quarter, the reduction reflects the continuation of production margin compression. Credit costs reflect the releases in both Mortgage Banking and Cards that we referred to on page 1. And core expenses were flattish both year over year and quarter over quarter, normalizing prior periods. We remain on track to deliver on our expense guidance. And headcount in the Consumer Bank and Mortgage business was down over 3,000 heads this quarter, a function of the evolution in the branch operating model and the completion of the IFR work. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches and close to 19,000 ATMs. And as of today we have over 1,400 Chase private client locations. On page 5, Consumer- Business Banking. Net income of $641 million, and an ROE of 24%, on net revenue of $4.2 billion, down 2% year on year and quarter on quarter. The sequential decline is due to fewer days in the quarter for net interest income and seasonality in non-interest revenue. We continue to see pressure on deposit margins. 8 basis points down in the quarter and 32 basis points year over year. But this continues to be largely offset by deposit growth of 11% year over year, which we believe is significantly faster than the industry. And this quarter we had the lowest customer attrition on record, which reflects the great progress that we're making on the customer experience. And we were just named winner of four TNS Choice Awards, recognizing superior performance in customer acquisitions, retention, satisfaction and market share with consumer and affluent banking customers, which is more than any financial institution has earned in any year. Average Business Banking loan balances of $18.7 billion are flattish quarter over quarter. And in the drivers you can see loan production decreased this quarter due to softer demand and higher competitive intensity. However, the pipeline in the second quarter is looking stronger. We had record investment sales of over $9 billion, up 40% year on year. And client investment assets up 15%. Which shows that we're penetrating our customers more deeply, with 70% of those sales, up from 50% last year, being managed money, driving strong recurring revenues. Finally on this page, expenses are up year over year, reflecting the investments we are making in the business, including new branch builds and one-time costs related to a contract renegotiation. Turning to page 6 and Mortgage Banking. Overall net income of $673 million, and an ROE of 14%. If you look at the top of the table in the first blue highlighted item, production pretax income was $427 million, down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by continued margin compression. As we expected and as we talked about last quarter, gain on sale margins continued to come down this quarter, and reached levels of around 100 basis points on a pretax basis. Which compares to a normalized pretax margin in the fourth quarter of last year of around 180 basis points. And was driven by a significant tightening in primary and secondary spreads, as well as pricing pressure, reflecting increased capacity in the market. Strong originations of $53 billion were up 37% year on year and 3% sequentially. While applications were actually down 8% from last quarter. But we continue to expect high levels of refinancing and close loan volumes in the next quarter to remain solid. Production expense increased year on year on higher volumes, and net repurchases of $81 million in the quarter, reflects a reduction in realized losses, partially offset by reserve releases. We continue to believe we're adequately reserved and we do expect reserve releases to broadly offset losses over time. Moving down to Servicing. Revenue of $778 million increased sequentially, primarily due to one-time gains associated with buying, curing and reselling certain delinquent loans out of securities. Servicing expenses of $737 million included a small amount of final IFR costs as we wound down the work this quarter, and also some severance. And if you back those costs out, Servicing expenses were slightly lower than the $725 million normalized run rate we talked about last quarter. IFR costs are now out of our run rate. And we continue to expect Servicing costs to reduce to $600 million by the fourth quarter of this year. MSR risk management was a modest loss, $142 million. The driver of the net loss is an increase in our expectations for home price appreciation this year, which is a great thing but drove an approximate negative $400 million within the model update line in the supplement given higher prepayments. And, although there's an upfront negative in the mark of the Servicing assets, improvements in home prices will drive lower credit losses over time that will more than outweigh this mark. Finally on this page, real estate portfolios showed pretax income of $784 million, which includes net charge-offs of around $450 million this quarter, and compared to a normalized fourth-quarter number of $520 million. This reflects lower delinquencies, as well as lower severities as home prices improve, and net to release reserves of $650 million this quarter. As you've seen, charge-offs have been steadily declining, and we do expect that to continue but at a more moderated pace. And we've updated our guidance for you to expect quarterly net charge-offs to be at or below $400 million. If you turn to page 7, Cards, Merchant Services and Auto. Net income of $1.3 billion, up 8% year on year, or up 33% if you exclude the change in loan loss reserves and ROE of 33%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was flat year on year, but down quarter on quarter with quarter one having seasonally lower loan balances, sales volumes and merchant processing volumes. Expenses were down both year over year and quarter on quarter, primarily driven by non-core expense items in the comparable period. Net charge-offs continue to be low. And we released $500 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in early stage roll rates. The net charge-off rate of 3.55%, while down over 80 basis points year over year, was up slightly quarter on quarter on lower loan balances. And consistent with Investor Day, you should expect up to $1 billion of Card reserve releases in the full year of 2013, including the $500 million reflected this quarter. Year-on-year growth in sales volume was strong at 9%. And the revenue rate of 12.83% reflects strong interchange revenue and merchant processing fees, with merchant processing volumes up 15% year on year. And moving on to Auto, originations were up 12% year on year, and 18% quarter on quarter. And although the first quarter is seasonally stronger, this growth outpaced the normal seasonal pattern. We gained share in the quarter through improved competitive positioning in prime. And also saw strong growth with our private-label manufacturing partners. Moving on to slides 8 and 9 and the Corporate- Investment Bank. Very strong first-quarter results. And the results this quarter included a small DVA gain of $126 million, versus a loss in the same quarter of last year of $900 million. Both of which you'll see in the credit adjustments line item in the tables. So, if we focus on the numbers, excluding DDA, $2.5 billion of net income on $10 billion of revenue, down 2% year on year but up 22% quarter on quarter and with an ROE of 18%. Total banking revenue of $3 billion, up 12% year on year, driven by higher IB fees of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% year on year with record bond underwriting. And lending-related revenue of $500 million, primarily core NII and fees on retained loans and commitments. And to a lesser extent gains on positions of fees in loan restructuring. Total markets and investor services revenue of $7 billion, down 7% year on year, driven by fixed income markets of $4.8 billion. Down 5% year on year, coming off of a very strong first quarter last year. And up 50% quarter on quarter on seasonality, with continued strength in the client franchise. The P&L impact from the remaining synthetic credit portfolio included here was insignificant this quarter but positive. Equity markets of $1.3 billion, down 6% year on year, but up 50% quarter on quarter. And the sequential change reflects seasonally strong equity derivatives results. Security services revenues of $974 million were flat year on year and down slightly quarter on quarter. And while a portion of this reflects the depository of receipts business, which is seasonally down, the portion that reflects our custody business has grown in line with assets under custody, which were $19.3 trillion, up 8% year on year. And we're seeing positive expense trends. Year on year, a net reduction of 2%, driven by lower compensation and efficiency initiatives, substantially offset this quarter by litigation expenses. If you take the DVA and the restructuring gains I mentioned, as well as the litigation expense, they net out. The comp to revenue ratio ex DVA of 34% is in line with our guidance. And at the bottom of the driver section, you can see that our average CIB VAR continues to decline this quarter to $62 million, reflecting lower levels of risk including the continued derisking of the synthetic credit portfolio. But also reflecting very low levels of volatility across multiples assets classes. On page 9, before I skip over this page, you can see that we continue to make progress growing our international loans and deposits. Our international loan balances were up 9% since the end of 2012, with particular strength across Asia and EMEA. Moving on to page 10 and the Commercial Bank. This quarter saw net income of nearly $600 million, on $1.7 billion of revenue, flat year over year with a return on equity of 18%. Underlying loan growth of 11% year on year includes our C&I portfolio, which grew 12%, in line with the industry. And our commercial real estate book, which grew 10% year over year, significantly above the industry, driven by commercial term lending. Quarter over quarter, loan balances were generally flat, consistent with the industry, partly reflecting the fact that some demand was pulled forward into the fourth quarter. But also reflecting lower levels of demand and increased competition. Loan spreads held up well this quarter and remained stable to last quarter. And credit quality continued to be very strong. Lastly here, expenses up 8% year on year on the continued investment in the business, and increased operating expenses for Commercial Card. Turning to page 11. Our Asset Management business had record net income for a first quarter of $487 million, up 26% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter, with an ROE of 22%. 12% year-on-year revenue growth reflects an increase in management fees, driven by strong long-term net inflows, including a record $31 billion this quarter, marking the 16th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows. We also had higher equity and fixed income markets, up 9% based on our business mix. And saw higher performance fees driven by strong fund returns in 2012. We had record loan balances, up over $20 billion, driven by increases in US mortgage and international loan growth. Total AUM was close to $1.5 trillion, with over $1 trillion in long-term AUM. And lastly, higher headcount expenses and performance-related comps contributed to a 9% year-over-year expense growth. But the pretax margin of 29% also increased from 26% last year, reflecting an improvement in operating leverage. Moving on to page 12, Corporate and Private Equity. Total net income of $250 million for the quarter, and reflected a Private Equity net loss of $182 million, including nearly $300 million of unrealized losses related to specific positions. Treasury and CIO net income was $24 million. And included about $500 million of net securities gains, offset by about $470 million of negative NII due to low rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. Both the private equity losses and the securities gains were more significant this quarter than usual, and netted to positive $200 million pretax. Finally, other corporate net income of just over $400 million includes $230 million of prior period tax adjustments. And finishing on guidance, in CIO Treasury our guidance remains a net loss of $300 million plus or minus. And in other corporate, our guidance remains $100 million, plus or minus of net income. With both numbers able to vary quarter over quarter. Turning to page 13 and net interest margin, firm-wide NIM declined 3 basis points and core NIM 2 basis points quarter on quarter. A number of items affected our NIM. First, to the negative. The low rate environment continues to affect our reinvestment opportunities. And also competitive pressures continue to impact loan yields. On the positive side, investment securities yields increased from higher mortgage-backed securities income, driven by slower prepayments and reduced secured financing. And lower long-term debt costs reflected a change in mix. Lastly, our outlook on page 14. We've covered most of these items already. But you'll see that we've changed our NIM and NII guidance to put it all together in one place and on a consistent basis. All numbers shown are pretax and are estimates of net NII, reflecting both rate compression and volume growth. So you should expect modest NIM compression during the year with absolute levels of NII very strongly supported by growth in interest-earning assets. While overall NII expected to be down about 1% this year. Lastly, you may have seen we will redeem about $5 billion of outstanding trust preferreds in the second quarter. And as a heads up, this will lead to a modest one-time loss in the second quarter, but also a lower cost of debt over time. Wrapping up, we had a record quarter with high-quality earnings and strong underlying business performance, seeing positive momentum across our businesses. Thank you for joining us. Operator, you can open up the call for Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: John, we can't hear you. Apologies, John, we didn't hear the question.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we can.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're growing, as you've probably seen, we showed you on Investor Day. And while there was a little bit of lower growth this quarter, we do expect to grow loans in our commercial bank loans in Asset Management, wholesale loans, Mortgage Banking. And we're growing our deposits very strongly. So it's really just the underlying business driver growth that we've been seeing and expect to continue.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. John, actually, if I refer you back -- and from recollection, I'll do it for you -- but if I refer you back to Investor Day, it's based upon our adjusted expenses, which are defined as our expenses excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters. Which in 2012 was $60 billion, plus or minus. I think $60.1 billion. And we're expecting to be $59 billion this year. And that's what we're on track to deliver.
MARIANNE LAKE: A little higher than that in the first quarter. But the first quarter is seasonally high.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. The fourth-quarter normalized run rate was $725 million. This quarter it's down a little off that, as you would expect, given the IFR completion. We said that we expected the fourth quarter to be running at $600 million. And we said that at Investor Day and we're still on track to do that. And we've also said that the long-term run rate for that part of the business would be about $325 million a quarter, and that would be over the next couple of years.
MARIANNE LAKE: The litigation dropped quarter over quarter. Clearly we had a large number last quarter on the back of IFR. And we did have litigation expense this quarter, you'll see in the supplementary there, just over $300 million.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, that's right, John.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, but also remember, we didn't buy back shares in the fourth quarter or the third quarter. So there was an overall net $2.6 billion gross] $2,6 billion net of employee issuance.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: No. I think the issuance number is fairly level and consistent quarter by quarter, because it's really based upon amortization of restricted stock and all that. And the buyback, the $2.6 billion, remember, that was over the course of the quarter, so it averaged out to 50% of that for the quarter. So we can give you more detail a little bit later.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, we'll come back to you John.
JAMIE DIMON: But the $6 billion will offset how much average amortization over the same 12-month period, like $2 billion.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, $2 billion. John, that's a good way of looking at it. The $6 billion we're authorized to repurchase relates to employee issuance over the same period of just a little bit over $2 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: For accounting purposes.
JAMIE DIMON: The second one is the big one, that's June 11, or something like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, June 11.
JAMIE DIMON: And that's where you have a lot of bigger client stuff like that. People are still getting used to it. So we think -- I think we've got 30% or 40% lined up to do it. They're still reading documents, have to sign new documents. So hopefully it will go smoothly. It's unlikely to go smoothly the first round. The first round were really large participants and swap deals, et cetera. We'll have to just wait and see.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, we really don't know. I would say temporary but probably still down a little bit because of the reason you gave. Some feel and just say -- we don't need to do this anymore. And we also know all the final rules, by the way, and how the SCFs are going to work in bidding.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. If you take -- our Basel I RWA went up about $200 million. That's all about the implementation of the new market risk rules in Basel 2.5. Which is also why you saw our ratio go down from a reported 11% last quarter. It's really all explained by that. And our Basel III RWA was flattish quarter over quarter, with some pluses and some minuses.
JAMIE DIMON: That was already in there essentially.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Of course, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: My recollection -- and, again, Glenn, forgive me if I get this wrong -- it's on the slide from the firm overview and Investor Day -- but I think that 100 basis points equates to about $180 billion of RWA over the next two years. But, remember, the passive runoff will take place over time. Not completely linearly but over time. And the model enhancements can be a little bit lumpier and a little bit more back ended. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But, yes, we're still expecting for those things to happen, for us to get 100 basis points of benefit from that, and that's without the active mitigation. That's going to happen over the course of time. Just check that slide for me, Glenn, when you get on.
JAMIE DIMON: Glenn, I actually think you all on the line should be dealing with this issue a little bit because the reason you have companies is because they serve clients well at a good cost. There's a reason our numbers are good, because we have cross sell and clients come to us. And there are reasons for global banks, just like there are reasons for community banks. I think the real issue -- again, you guys do the numbers -- is the banking system has gotten so much stronger in the United States. And it's not just capital, but it's capital, liquidity, oversight. Activities that people like are no longer being done. Derivatives are going to clearing houses. And the initial wave of OLA and living wills, et cetera, those things should all work. I hope at one point we declare a victory and just stop eating our young at this thing.
MARIANNE LAKE: Betsy, there was a little bit of passive mitigation. There was a little bit of run-off. And there was also some declines as we purchased back some AFS securities, and those were offset by some other things. It wasn't a very big number because, as I say, that will bleed in over time. And the model enhancements which are about 50% of the 100-basis-point benefit will be a bit back ended.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right. Yes, some of it later this year, some of it next.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. We showed you at Investor Day that we had a gap to be fully compliant. We're going to be fully compliant by the end of the year. We did close that gap this quarter, not completely, by about one-third. Obviously we also disclosed -- on the slide you'll see our HQLA, our high quality liquid assets which has a relationship. They've gone up. But that's the numerator and the denominator changes, too. So think about it as we've made good progress. We've closed the gap by about one-third and we're on the way to compliance.
JAMIE DIMON: And I think, when Marianne gave you the forecast going forward for NIM, that includes changing how we create more LCR.
JAMIE DIMON: On the quantitative stuff we passed. And that's why we got the capital plan. There are criticisms around qualitative. And from what we know now, and we're still doing work, we're going to give you more, is around -- they want more granular type of forecasting. They want more idiosyncratic type of forecasting. So we're having conversations with them. Marianne has formed a CCAR department which is going to become experts in CCAR.
MARIANNE LAKE: And, Betsy, in terms of the time line, we're resubmitting, as requested, in the third quarter. We're doing everything between now and then to remediate and improve our processes following their feedback. So we're committed to being successful.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so Brennan, I think it's very hard to predict. And you're right, it bounces around and it can be noisy. We had a higher level of litigation reserves in the first quarter of last year. And we hope that the numbers will remain low but we can't predict them for you, I'm afraid.
JAMIE DIMON: They're always going to be lumpy because we have to deal with these things in due course. I think in the prior years we put away a lot. We've always kept the same, predominantly mortgage, largely mortgage, et cetera. And obviously the fact we're not doing more means we think we've gotten there. We did a lot of work on that. It could always change. But we've done thorough analysis. As a lot of you all did, by the way. We did it at the tranche level almost. So, could it be permanently lower? Yes, it could be permanently lower. It doesn't have to go higher. But, obviously, a lot of things coming our way and we'll have to reserve appropriately as they come in.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's tough to predict but maybe the thing you could look at is, if you take our pretax spread right now of 100 basis points, that compares to a longer-term average run rate of 65 basis points before the crisis. We've been stepping down from a very high level at the beginning of 2012. And we're back to a level where, frankly, we're not that far away from the longer-term run rate. And it's driven by the primary-secondary spread, which came in about 20 basis points in the quarter, back to levels that, again, feel more normal. I don't know I could say what inning we're in, I'm not a sports person, but it doesn't feel like we have another big step change to go.
JAMIE DIMON: But we expect it might be up a little bit next quarter, not down, for a variety of reasons.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. There's going to be volatility quarter on quarter, but for this year we think we're in and around this range.
JAMIE DIMON: A lot of that business is -- we call it flow business. So we look at credit, emerging markets, rates, FX. The clients -- we deal with clients all around the world and they need those services. Obviously, we always try to become more efficient. So if you look at FX, I'm going to say 80% is electronic. If you look at rates, the electronic number's going to go up. And so we're going to drive efficiency. But we still think clients are going to need it. There will be spreads to pay for it. And, obviously, everyone is going to be adjusting to Basel III. As you pointed out, some people leaving the business, some are getting into the business. We think it has a good future. We don't think it's going to go away.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you're confusing two different things. I really think that quality -- they're going to give us more feedback on where they say we fell short in quality. I've mentioned them -- idiosyncratic, more level detail, more enterprise-wide type of forecasting, et cetera. That's one issue. The second is the actual dollar amount. The Fed has made it very clear, they want people to get to their Basel III targets. Ours is at least 9.5%. Ben Bernanke said on a speech he gave that the banks that they did the stress tests on have more capital after extreme stress than they started in the crisis. So the Fed, I think, is feeling more and more comfortable, not just individual banks but the system as a whole. And we reduced the 15 down to 6 because we wanted to get to our 9.5% target faster. That's why we did it. We just changed our mind. We want to get to 9.5% this year, we want to get to LCR this year. And obviously they may change the stress test next year. And assume we're going to have a conservation buffer coming in. And we don't know how the interplay of those two things will work.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think it's too early.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, it's too early for us to tell that. Remember, that's going to relate to how fast you grow and other requests from regulators. So we'll take that when we get there.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, but we do -- Erika, we do expect that we will be continuing to grow capital just through this 100 basis points of passive runoff from mitigation. Certainly our capital levels will be stronger and we're just going to have to see how things play out.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, if I could -- a little difficult to side it for you. But we did see a lot of still the pull forward to the fourth quarter, just given the year-end issues that people were concerned about. And so that has had an impact. I think it's slightly less of an impact than in terms of the competitive landscape. And there are deals being done with terms and conditions and pricing that we're not comfortable with at the moment, and we're just remaining very disciplined. So that has had an impact for us.
MARIANNE LAKE: Broadly flat. Broadly flat, around 32%.
MARIANNE LAKE: Broadly flat at around 32%.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: Broadly flat. Flat.
MARIANNE LAKE: Actually, we saw declines in deposits. So they're using their cash. They're waiting it out.
MARIANNE LAKE: Mike, it's Marianne. We're in constant dialogue with our regulators. And so we know that we should be expecting some more consent orders. But to clarify for you, they relate to issues that we've been working on over the course of the last several years. So these are not new breaking issues that will surprise you in any material way.
MARIANNE LAKE: Mike, we can't really go into the detail of the reports in specifics. But we obviously respect the work of the subcommittee. We respect the findings they had and we're working very hard to fix our issues. As it relates to the proposal and the recommendation to require documentation associated with portfolio hedging, identifying the specific risks that the hedge is designed to mitigate, and then monitoring it over time, we tend to agree that that makes a lot of sense in the context of what we face.
MARIANNE LAKE: No. And actually there's a couple of things I would say. First, that we're organizing ourselves around the control and regulatory agenda because it's a high priority for us. And we're getting ourselves organized in the same way as we would around a merger or an acquisition. And in doing that we are prioritizing our work. But we're not changing our overall strategy. We're not going to change the way we treat our customers, how we think about growing our businesses. But at the margin we're going to refocus our energies on making sure that we execute on the commitments to improve the control and regulatory environments.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so applications actually have come back up. Rates have come down a little in the second quarter. For us in particular, starting there, we're expecting re-fi volumes to stay high. We did see a little bit of an increase in purchase volumes in the applications in the first quarter, albeit from a smaller base. And also we did the Met Life transaction so we have the opportunity to be working that portfolio. So our view on volumes for the year is that they're going to remain solid, although there will be some volatility really on the back of continued strength in refinancing. And you saw the HARP extension so more broadly for the market I think re-fi including HARP will be a level of support for volumes this year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Honestly, it's really all part of how we think about positioning the organization. And being compliant with LCR is part of our new reality. It's just a part of -- we've embedded it into just how we're thinking about the overall positioning of the firm. So it's not something we're separating out for you.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's hard for me to predict the second quarter. It is a real reduction in risk across the portfolio including -- and not driven by but including -- the synthetic credit portfolio which we continue to derisk. But it is important to note, if you look across the asset classes, there's been a very significant decline in the levels of volatility that affect the time series for our lookback period. So that, necessarily, bad days rolled off and better days rolled on. And so, when we compute our VaR it's pushing the VaR down lower. So, as long as volatility remains low and we continue to derisk, there's reasons to believe they'll be at or around this level. But it is going to be subject to changes in volatility, as and when they happen.
JAMIE DIMON: It's factored in.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes It's an all-in number for us. So, to the degree we expect that to happen by the year end, it's all part of the number, including some capacities to buy shares, the whole thing.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'll take the two things separately, the PPNR separate from trading losses. On the trading losses, obviously there's a number of different stresses that we do. And while our number was different, I don't think we feel like there's anything about our processes that is materially going to change. But as it relates to PPNR, we did get feedback that we need to look at certain of our revenue models and we need to look at them more centrally. And, as Jamie said, with a slightly more negative view, idiosyncratically. And we're going to do that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, a couple of things. One is, we are expecting to, and hoping to -- we've set a target for ourselves to gain share -- we do expect volumes to be supported by refinancing this year. That is our expectation. It could change, of course. As it relates to the cost structure, obviously that comes down a little bit more slowly over time but we're making progress. And we talked about the fact that we expect that to be down at $600 million run rate for the fourth quarter. And down to $325 million sometime over the next couple of years. And we're actively working on optimizing our servicing business, both the core performing servicing -- and you saw that obviously with the Met Life deal -- but also, where it would make sense, we would be open to doing sales on subservicing of delinquent loans. And we're working through all those things to try and get to cost structures to the best place it can be.
JAMIE DIMON: The private equity, we've always told you, is lumpy. It was just markdowns and write-downs of existing positions. And we don't go through the specific names. But, obviously, we hope it will earn a profit. It just wasn't a particularly good quarter for private equity. And the private equity legally can survive Volcker and all those things. We like the business. We like the people. And you just have to do it in a different basis, that's all.
JAMIE DIMON: No. There's no seasonality in private equity. It's constantly being reviewed.
MARIANNE LAKE: And it's lumpy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Absolutely. Guy, it's a big change from the fourth quarter, off a small number. So, not to diminish the size of the numbers, but positive $50 million, negative $80 million, plus or minus around the zero level. What that's a factor of, Guy, is that the reserve release is based upon our model, and realized losses is based upon agency activity. So the timing isn't exactly perfect. So realized losses came down from about $200 million to $180 million. And we didn't build reserves. We released them, just not at the same order of magnitude. And it's really to do with timing, which is why we say that we do expect over time they'll net to zero. Last quarter it was a small positive. This quarter it's a small negative. Nothing to read into it.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're in constant dialogue with the regulators. We obviously can't comment on the specifics of our conversations with them. We've had some very constructive conversations as we came out the 2013 CCAR process. And on the basis of those we're actively working to make the improvements they want us to make. But also expecting to continue to get more and more detailed feedback and actually hope to get some industry best practice information, too. So we're going to be working in partnership with them, in constant dialogue, all the way through this year so that we can be clear on what success looks like.
JAMIE DIMON: We haven't gotten a lot of feedback yet. So there will be more to come. But we're going to be geared up to do it. And I think we want to be best-in-class in CCAR. The answer is [absolutely positive] in PPNR. I mentioned just one -- idiosyncratic exposure and risk in PPNR. When you go through a stress test, you can assume that your company is just dealing with all those macroeconomic factors with your forecast. You can assume your company is going through those macroeconomic forecasts plus you're under some other kind of stress and you can lose market shares. Obviously that would change your PPNR. So we'll be having more dialogue and trying to figure out and make sure we do the right thing here.
JAMIE DIMON: No. This is just a resubmission of the progress program. And they like to see qualitative improvement. This is not a change of request at all. This is the one that Marianne referred to that will be in the third quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: We'll obviously do another CCAR in January.
JAMIE DIMON: No. The through-the-year accruals is almost exactly the same. It's based upon -- there's a lot of stuff that goes into that number but that really hasn't changed that much.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. And actually you've got to normalize out the DVA, which was a large loss last quarter. If we normalize that out, revenues are down. So it's not comped down on revenue. (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: I was referring to that we're constantly putting in new operationals, new systems to reduce overhead. Marianne already mentioned a bunch of things we're doing in Mortgage. You're seeing similar efforts in Consumer. That's a constant effort. We do have names for some of them, by the way. I'm just not going to mention them here.
MARIANNE LAKE: No.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you're referring to the CTL, the commercial term lending, which is lending against multi-family. And we have seen growth in it. Remember, that stuff is like 65% LTV. It did great through this last downturn so we're very comfortable with that kind of lending. I forgot where you --.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say a little of both.
JAMIE DIMON: Are you talking about the commercial bank or the total Company?
JAMIE DIMON: We would expect to be flat to down a little bit as companies use their -- they have a lot of deposits. So I think we, at Investor Day and earlier, told people they were really high and we expected it to come down, particularly before people start using their revolvers. So they do relate to each other.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know the answer to that.
MARIANNE LAKE: We did a whole page for you on where we thought the through-the-cycle reserve levels should be by business. And there are some businesses -- mortgage, most obviously -- that still have a way to go. And there are other businesses in the wholesale space, in the commercial bank, that are below that through the cycle. I would refer you back to that page. If you do the numbers, from recollection, on an annualized basis, our charge-offs have been more like $7 billion or $8 billion, which, while that is not dissimilar to charge-offs we've seen, it's for different reasons. So I would take a look at that page.
JAMIE DIMON: It's mostly mortgage that will come down. Think of everything else as close to normal. Mortgage, which in total is $9 billion, will eventually be a lot lower than that. But that could take a couple of years.
MARIANNE LAKE: To talk for us specifically, as you probably know, we've been very successful and proactive as it's relating to HARPing our own book. And by the end of this year we fully expected to have been as successful and mine that as far as possible, or they will carry on. That's not the case in the industry. So it's great news that HARP was extended out to the end of 2015. And it will allow for other servicers to get their ducks in a row and potentially to have cross service to HARP. Which, in turn, should be good in terms of volumes, although I don't think it will be a step change. For us we're not expecting it to be a significant difference in our production or in our MSR value.
MARIANNE LAKE: We talked about we peaked in our HARP volumes in about second quarter of last year. I think overall, first half of last year was high, came down slightly, overall 15% last year. We talked at Investor Day that we thought that would go down to the high single digits this year, and it is, in terms of percentage of our production. And we are very active and have been very proactive in mailing our HARP population. And expected to have completed the program by the end of the year. So we were on track and this doesn't change our expectations.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the total -- if you take all mortgages, I think the number's like 4 million would be HARP-able today if they went to it. I'm somewhat surprised that more people don't do it, to tell you the truth. Anything the government can do, either PR, I think the cross-servicing is probably a bigger one, will make it slightly better. The thing was just slightly better. It's not going to dramatically change mortgage.
JAMIE DIMON: We hope so. We don't know any better than you.
JAMIE DIMON: You really have to ask them. We'll leave this to them and the regulators, okay?
JAMIE DIMON: You've got to ask them.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you for spending some time with us.",0.2100000000000002,-0.9350000000000012,0,0.06294411749219442,0.08334408993783991
32,Q1_2012,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: Doug, thank you. So let me just -- let me talk about one thing and then we will open to your questions. One is the stock buyback. Obviously we got permission to buy back $15 billion worth of stock. We would have preferred to have been able to buy back substantial amounts below tangible book value, but we were unable to. We will always, as a discipline, buy back of the approximately $3 billion we issue every year, and that is the $3 billion we issue mostly for comp. And that is not on a GAAP basis. Because we issue before investing, etc. At 45 we will -- we reserve -- right now we are buying back at that rate, but we may do more. So we reserve the right at any point in time to do whatever we want and it's based upon basically four things. What are the organic opportunities? They might be there, portfolios or more organic growth. What are the investment opportunities? There are a lot of things you can buy, both investments or acquisitions, which we don't really expect big ones now. Our own desire to get quickly to... how fast do we want to get to our new capital requirements under Basel III. And the stock price. So it does not mean at $45 -- obviously if the stock goes up I think we will be consistent and we will buy less. When it goes down we will buy more. We are a buyer in size around tangible book value. And then, obviously, we reserve the right to change that at will. So let's open up to questions or comments about any subject at all. Questions and Answers
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I mean, look, you said it yourself, anyone can do the numbers. Our tangible book value is extremely attractive, at $40 it would probably be attractive and at $45 --I am not saying it's not attractive, but our best thing is to grow our business and not to worry about buying back the stock. We are going to buy back the stock when it's a bargain, not just because we feel like it. And so you guys can all do the numbers, we are just not going to tell you what we are going to do.
JAMIE DIMON: We said flat expenses; we still expect that. The first quarter is a little bit higher because of FICA and payroll, a whole bunch of things like that, and some one-off expenses that run through there. And that is flat if you back out IB comp and extraordinary stuff. That number should be about $12 billion a quarter. Obviously it was a little bit higher this quarter if you do that, but it will come down over time we think.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, it's flat but we are still doing a lot of investing. So we are getting other efficiencies to help pay for the investing.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I constantly read about counterparties. Our numbers -- we disclosed around $15 billion, a little bit higher than that now. They obviously move around. I would still say exactly the same thing. The LTRO was a massive thing that took the real catastrophe in the short run-off the table, but obviously the world is going to evaluate over time whether the fiscal union is tightened and given teeth and carrots and sticks and all that. It's going to look at Spain and Italy's both austerity and growth plans, and it's going to be like an accordion for the next 18 months. So I personally am not going to overreact to that. But I think they have to do some things to give it the real stability. The LTRO wasn't sufficient. It was not a... it was a short-term fix not a permanent fix.
JAMIE DIMON: No, God, no. No, no. A lot of the NII is given to the businesses that generate the deposits on a consistent fund transfer methodology, which -- but not in the Investment Bank. Remember, most of that portfolio is an AFS portfolio, not all of it, but most of it.
JAMIE DIMON: We disclosed both realized gains, unrealized gains, and mark-to-market gains. You get all of that.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a complete tempest in a teapot. Every bank has a major portfolio; in those portfolios you make investments that you think are wise to offset your exposures. Obviously, it's a big portfolio; we are a large company and we try to run it -- it's sophisticated obviously with complex things. But at the end of the day that is our job is to invest that portfolio wisely, intelligently over a long period of time to earn income and to offset other exposures that we have.
JAMIE DIMON: Guy, I think the right way to look at that is ask that question in two years. I mean we are not at the Basel III targets yet. You should expect dividends on a regular -- we may change our minds, but on a regular annual basis from us that will look at what to do. Obviously, this is a Board-level decision. But there is going to certainly be no special dividend before we know what the real capital rules are.
JAMIE DIMON: Take that off the table.
JAMIE DIMON: They were several hundred million dollars higher than what we would call normal for a whole bunch of different reasons, including HARP, supply/demand, the price at which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are securitizing things. So I would expect that to normalize over time.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a measure of what you're going to get next quarter on revenues, but not -- on the volumes but not necessarily on the spreads.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not going to go through month-by-month numbers. I would say so far -- it was 10 days; it's going to be 60 plus days this quarter. And 10 days is a little bit lower than we saw in the first quarter. In my opinion, it does not reflect the next 50 days, though Doug mentioned there's usually been regular seasonality in the business, not just for us but for everybody. So whether that continues or not, who knows.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. It was a little bit -- I think it was 49 -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: It was $49 billion and change -JAMIE DIMON: And we are a little over that.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, give or take.
JAMIE DIMON: No, it was the completion of a thorough review of all the reps and warranty, all the litigation, all the tranches, all the Bear Stearns, etc., etc., but with a real view about all that. That is all.
JAMIE DIMON: It's just the final settlement, some taxes and pensions and certain assets and stuff like that. It has been in the works, you know, for three years. It's just we didn't account for it until it was all finalized.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no.
JAMIE DIMON: And part of it is discretionary, like how we invest in long-term funds over time. And we have been fairly conservative in that.
JAMIE DIMON: No, it is incorporated into everything we talk about.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. But, look, the important thing is that when we talk about this portfolio one of the bigger decisions you make, if you look at our portfolio -- and we disclosed we would benefit from rising rates. A lot of that comes out of CIO. It costs money to be there, but we think it's a conservative and proper way to run the Company because we worry about, you know, the fat tails, much higher rates not much lower rates. So we can change that and increase NIM tomorrow if we wanted to.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but we would have to feel at that point in time that we want to do it. And there are other ways to do it. You can buy spread products, not just fixed rate products.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, and we have told you all about that. That you would see in TSS a couple hundred million, in
JAMIE DIMON: In CB the same and a little bit in Consumer Banking.
JAMIE DIMON: All things being equal, which they are not.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess, Betsy, we don't know all the final capital rules. So if we were going to buy back the stock my preference would be get to whatever the rules are sooner rather than later, that is all. It's not that you lost the money, you can -- I always call that kind of earnings in store. You can redeploy your capital later. If after we know all the rules and we have an excess capital and that is the best thing to do for shareholders, obviously the Board will consider that. We are not going to consider it before we get to whatever the known capital rules are. And we are going to know a lot more, remember - but hopefully by the end of this year.
JAMIE DIMON: Betsy, we are not going to do it before we get to our capital rules. We don't know what they are.
JAMIE DIMON: But we don't know. Our expectation is 9.5% Basel III, but we don't know all the RWA rules, we don't know how it's going to come out, and we are not even sure about the 9.5%.
JAMIE DIMON: Buybacks, at the right price, are enormously valuable for shareholders and just paying out extra cash is not.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no, we didn't say they were moving up. What we said is that they might move up temporarily as some of them get freed up. But if you look at total delinquent -- seriously delinquent loans and total foreclosures from a year ago to today, to the end of this year, they are going to come down. Obviously they are kind of very lumpy as every bank goes around its own different thing, but homes for sale are down, inventory is down, delinquent loans are coming down, charge-offs are coming down, real money is coming in. So we are just saying we pretty much are at the bottom. I don't know the lumpiness by month or by quarter, but we are pretty much at the bottom here, as long as you have a recovery. Now if the United States goes back in a recession all bets are off.
JAMIE DIMON: You have got the 4 million new jobs, household formation will probably go up; that is all I am
JAMIE DIMON: What slide?
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but I think we mentioned the catch-up now with the AG foreclosure.
JAMIE DIMON: So I think we fully disclosed this about two years ago that we had identified a long time ago that when -- we were surprised to find out, by the way, that a lot of seconds were still paying when the first no longer was. But when we analyzed it it was pretty obvious it was just a timing difference that in almost all cases the first went delinquent, the second eventually went delinquent. And in all cases when the first went into foreclosure the second was a loss, basically a total loss. So we just recognized that in reserving years ago, that is all. We specifically reserved for specifically that thing, so
JAMIE DIMON: And it was $1.6 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: There are other little pockets like that we have too, by the way.
JAMIE DIMON: We are always conservative in that.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess, let me just put it this way, it is more than we thought. It's picking up a little bit, but I don't think it's going to completely change everything. You were seeing refis anyway and this just opens up a bigger universe to be refi'd. Other than that that we just couldn't give you the numbers offhand. We might have to get back to you on that.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I do think it's getting a little bit better and I do think that a lot of these things resolved during the course of this year, so hopefully that will be true. It's really a complex environment; we have got a lot of things to do to meet all the regulatory requirements, but I do think it's getting a little better.
JAMIE DIMON: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I pointed out at Investor Day that branches make about $1 million a branch. We have just adjusted the bill to make up for changes from Durbin and other things like that, but we are losing in total, I think we disclosed like $500 million a year in NIM.
JAMIE DIMON: We are running the Company such that we expect to get that back. So we are not going to make short-term decisions about branch builds because of short-term spread compression. We think the value is there and we are doing it, we are just are adjusting the branch build. And so what you are seeing is almost exactly what we told you. Durbin is $150 million a quarter, NIM is down by (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: You got to be -- the issue is that -- in our Wholesale you got really two big books. You have got the Commercial Bank, which was up substantially -- if I were you that is the one I would look at. You have the Investment Bank, but that one moves around dramatically as big companies borrow, pay it off. You got a bridge one that goes in and out, a conduit loan that goes in and out. So I wouldn't look at that one the same way. That just can go -- that can move dramatically quarter by quarter. What we saw -- if you look at the Investment Bank, a lot of debt issuance. Usually when you have huge debt issuance sometimes your bank loans go down.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, we have had eight straight quarters of Middle Market and C&I loan growth in the Commercial Bank. We have had probably four or five or six of straight quarters of small business loans going up. So if you are looking at the commercial world that is what I would look at. In the commercial -- in the consumer bank we have had consistent growth in deposits and we have a NIM going down a little bit because of the interest rate environment. But the underlying deposits, clients, flows is actually pretty good. And credit card spend is good and debit card spend is good, but you have NIM compression. We can go over it a 1,000 times; we are going to have NIM compression. Think of that as like the cost of mozzarella for pizza, when it goes up your margins go down a little bit. It doesn't mean you are selling less pizza.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, that was a dumb analogy. Tasty, but --.
JAMIE DIMON: Nothing. Remember there is a lot of things that go in the comp ratio of the Bank, but I think the best way to think about it is 35%, give or take. We have always said 35 to 40%, but a lot of things affect that and that is the way we book it. Nothing has changed. And the reserve takedowns were in mortgages and credit card and they are required. The accountants look at a whole bunch of numbers; they make you take it down. So we had to take it down. We don't expect -- I think it's important we don't expect big take -- reduction reserves in Credit Card anymore. Mortgage over time will have to come down as the book gets smaller and charge-offs come down.
JAMIE DIMON: Maybe, we don't really know. We have got to see what happens to charge-offs over time.
JAMIE DIMON: You are barking up the wrong tree. If you want to model, your model should be 37.5 and just leave it there. We have consistently for years charged capital to businesses, looked at risk-adjusted returns, multiple year returns, and all the things like that so our basic methodology is not going to change.
JAMIE DIMON: You may see at the percentage payout come back. We were already at the low end relative to competition.
JAMIE DIMON: I think there are reasons that the comp ratio is going to come down, but -- and I know Jes has spoken about it, so I do think there are pressures that will bring it down which are more related to competitive pressures than just that number.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, you know, it is but we had very good volumes. And you are absolutely correct, volumes drive it, spreads drive it, and kind of your positioning drives it a little bit. But volumes will be probably the primary driver. Obviously we want to do a good job positioning the inventory too.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, all things being equal, when that happens it will be a benefit to your trading results. If it goes the other way, it's usually a negative. It's not necessarily that way, because you can position for it. So if I were you, you could look at volume, spreads, and you can make your own estimate, but every company takes different positions and tries to protect themselves from that. But all things being equal that is a backwind for trading, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: It was a little bit of a benefit this quarter but it would be a mistake to start to break that out, because you don't have to be positioned that way. That is why it's a mistake to break it out that way.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we have told that you should start seeing it like every quarter for the next eight quarters. It will be a little lumpy, but my guess is eight quarters from now it will be a lot less than it is today.
JAMIE DIMON: It's hard to speak about this in a consolidated thing. Probably for the most part in TS we see it, you see it in Commercial Bank it's going to be more to pricing pressure than it is to margin pressure and loans. And if you see it -as Doug said is probably mostly in the consumer banks.
JAMIE DIMON: But each business is a little different.
JAMIE DIMON: I forgot what it was last year, but it was 600 last year, it's quick to be a 500 this year, it's going to be 350 the year after that, it's going to be 250 -- it's just going to come down over time as the portfolio runs off.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think we saw any real material market share gains here... in Europe.
JAMIE DIMON: But why did this $1.6 billion move and not the other $2.4 billion?
JAMIE DIMON: The other stuff has a better LTV make up than that $1.6 million.
JAMIE DIMON: You got it.
JAMIE DIMON: Operator, you can go to the next one.
JAMIE DIMON: Two separate things. First of all, there is competition in pricing. I am surprised to hear it's us, but I have heard that before. We went and checked and we see no evidence of that. Obviously, we don't want to drive the market like that. It has got nothing to do with interest rate exposure. We don't look at -- we have sort of match fund loans the way we look at loans. We don't say, okay, we will take the interest rate exposure and pass it on to the client.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: But, Paul, that is because we are a new competitor out West so obviously we are competing out West to gain share. Everything we do out West -- remember we didn't have a big Middle Market operation out West, so everything we are doing is taking share from someone. As opposed to like you would go to the Midwest where it's a lot more renewals than it is new business. So I understand why you hear that out West.
JAMIE DIMON: Absolutely not. It may be cheapened for the industry, but it has nothing to do with us.
JAMIE DIMON: We reserved a bunch of that stuff in prior quarters. It cost us $200 million in this quarter and most of the rest is incorporated in loan-loss reserves and it's already in our higher servicing costs. We have already been running to the Consent Orders and things like that, so it's not like -- it's not going to add additional servicing costs. We also, as you point out, recognize some of it in the MSR already. (multiple speakers) MSR relating to some of that.
JAMIE DIMON: You are welcome.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I don't think it does that at all. I think we all compete in the marketplace and I don't think that your capital ratios change your competition necessarily in the marketplace. We are all waiting for more guidance from the regulators, not like there is a total competition for capital. Then the RWA mitigation -- it's two pieces, okay. It's really -- one piece is simply the run-off of stuff which is going to go away.
JAMIE DIMON: That is happening every quarter. We have already talked about the consumer portfolio running off. There are a couple of things in the IB running off, there are a couple of things -- and the second is just the normal adoption of modeling capabilities that could be used in B III. That is all. That were not being used before because you didn't need to. It's those two things and they are rolling in over time.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think so. Folks, thank you for spending some time with us and we will talk to you soon.",0.16000000000000014,-0.11400000000000003,0,0.0715230731260307,0.10276674858706103
33,Q4_2019,"
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.5 billion, EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $29.2 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Underlying performance continues to be strong. Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale, with average balances up 7% year-on-year. We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots, as average loans across the company were up 3% year-on-year, excluding the impact of Home Lending loan sales from prior quarters. Client investment assets in Consumer & Business Banking were up 27%, and Asset & Wealth Management AUM was up 19%, reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic growth. We ranked #1 for the full year in global IBCs with 9% wallet share, and gross IB revenue in the Commercial Bank was a record $2.7 billion. In CIB markets, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year. However, it's important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms, in fact, a record fourth quarter. And credit performance continues to be strong across the company. On to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year, with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up $2.6 billion or 21% on higher revenue in CIB markets and AWM and continued strong performance in Home Lending and auto. Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 4% on volume and revenue-related costs. Credit remained favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations. Turning to the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $36.4 billion and EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion, all records; and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Revenue was up $7.2 billion or 6% year-on-year, with net interest income of $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Noninterest revenue was up $5.1 billion or 9%, driven by growth across consumer and higher CIB markets revenue. And expenses of $65.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue-related costs partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year. And on credit, performance remained strong throughout 2019. Credit costs were $5.6 billion. In consumer, credit costs were up $210 million, reflecting an increasing CAR due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit costs in Home Lending. And in Wholesale, we were up $504 million, largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries, both in 2018. Moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. And while on the topic of capital, it's worth noting, given the actions we have taken, we fully expect it will remain in the 3.5% G-SIB bucket. Before we move into the business results, I'll spend a moment talking about CECL on Page 5. As you know, the transition to CECL is effective on January 1, and therefore, there is no impact to our 2019 financials. On the page is the CECL adoption impact, an overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion, which is at the lower end of the range we've provided. This was driven by an increase in consumer of $5.7 billion, mostly coming from Cards partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale of $1.4 billion. In Cards, the increase is a result of moving to lifetime loss coverage versus a shorter loss emergence period under the incurred model. Whereas in Wholesale, modeling changes, like using specific macroeconomic forecast versus through-the-cycle loss rates under-incurred, result in a decrease, especially given the forecasted credit environment. Recognition of the allowance increase has resulted in a $2.7 billion after-tax decrease to retained earnings, as you can see on the page. Also important to note, we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital. And now turning to businesses, we'll start with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%, with accelerating deposit growth of 5%, client investment assets up 27% and total loans down 6%. For the full year, results in CCB were strong with $16.6 billion of net income, up 12%, and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $55.9 billion, up 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increase in client investment assets as well as account and transaction growth. Home Lending revenue was down 5%, driven by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 17%, reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue, predominantly offset by higher net production revenue, reflecting a 94% increase in origination. And in Cards, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 1% -- 2%, driven by revenue-related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, including market expansion, largely offset by expense efficiencies. On credit. This quarter, CCB had a net reserve release of $150 million. This included a release in Home Lending purchased credit impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in Card of $100 million, driven by growth. Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion, largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7. For the fourth quarter, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year. For the full year, CIB delivered record revenue of $38 billion and an ROE of 14%. In Investment Banking, IB fees reached an all-time record for the full year. We maintained our #1 rank in global IB fees and grew share to its highest level in a decade. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion was up 6% year-on-year, outperforming the market which was flat. Advisory fees were down 3% following a record performance last year. On a sequential quarter basis, fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions. And for the year, ranked #2 in gained share. Debt underwriting fees were up 11% year-on-year due to higher bond issuance activity as clients accelerate their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance sheets. And for the year, we maintained our #1 rank overall. We were #1 for [reinvest] positions in both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America. The new issuance market continued to be active, and for the year, we ranked #1 in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5 billion, up 56% year-on-year, driven by record fourth quarter revenue in both Fixed Income and Equity Markets. Fixed Income Markets was up 86%, benefiting from a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses, notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows. Equity Markets was 15%, driven by strength across cash and primes. Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, down 3% year-on-year, primarily due to deposit margin compression which was largely offset by organic growth; while Security Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3%. Expenses of $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal-, volume- and revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROE of 16% for the fourth quarter; and for the year, $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year, with lower deposit NII on lower margins, largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on a strategic investment. Gross Investment Banking revenues were $634 million, up 5% year-on-year, driven by increased large deal activity. Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion, up 10%, on strong activity across segments with record results for both Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. Expenses of $882 million were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology. Deposit balances were up 8% year-on-year as we continued to see strong client flows. Loan balances were up 1% year-on-year. C&I loans were up 2%, driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion markets partially offset by the runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio. CRE loans were up 1%, where we continued to see higher originations in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remained selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $110 million with an NCO rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by a single name which was reserved for in prior quarters. Underlying credit performance continues to be strong. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $785 million, with pretax margin of 28% and ROE of 29% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, AWM generated net income of $2.8 billion with both pretax margin and ROE of 26%. Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year. And for the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $14 billion, driven by Fixed Income and multi-asset. And we had net liquidity inflows of $37 billion. AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client assets of $3.2 trillion, both records, were up 19% and 18%, respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products. Deposits were up 8% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. And finally, we had record loan balances, up 8%, with strength in both Wholesale and Mortgage Lending. Now on to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $361 million. Revenue was a loss of $228 million for the current quarter, driven by approximately $190 million of net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments. Sequentially, revenue was down $920 million due to lower rates, the benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales as well as the PE losses I just mentioned. Year-on-year revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates. Expenses of $343 million were down $165 million year-on-year due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year. And turning to Page 11 for the outlook. At Investor Day, as always, we'll give you more information on the full year outlook. However for now, I'll provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. We expect NII to be approximately $14 billion, market-dependent; adjusted expenses to be about $17 billion. And as a reminder, the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments, and as a result, is currently estimated to be approximately 17%, with the managed tax rate about 500 to 700 basis points higher. So to wrap up, 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenue, net income and EPS. Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive, underpinned by the strength of the U.S. consumer. And despite expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well positioned as we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business model. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Questions and Answers
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. As we look at rates paid, on the retail side, we didn't, obviously, have reprice on the way up, and so there's little to do on the way down. In fact there, from a rates paid perspective, we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates paid tick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs. And then on the Wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down as you would expect, and we did see betas accelerate after the second cut. So there, we saw more of a decline in CIB than we did in CB or AWM, as you might expect. Importantly though, as we always say on the Wholesale side, we price client-by-client. And so we're not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And then I would just say in terms of the outlook, with the Fed on hold, the implieds do still have 1 cut later in 2020. And based on the latest implieds, we'll give you more detail at Investor Day as we always do. But I would say NII for the full year of 2020, flat is slightly down, as the headwinds from rates will be offset with balance growth.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So the fourth quarter definitely, I would say, stabilized. Things trade certainly stabilized. Things, broadly speaking, stopped getting worse. And so we saw sentiment improve a bit, which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter. And then, certainly, there are some puts and takes. I mean, the U.S. consumer remains in very strong shape, both from a credit perspective, sentiment, spending. Obviously, labor market is very strong. And the Fed and the ECB on hold. And then capital spending still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was 6 months ago. So we have a, broadly speaking, constructive outlook headed in -- as we're heading into 2020 here.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So I'll start with the provisioning. So look, I think it's fair to say under CECL, you could have incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macroeconomic forecasts. But there, that would depend, of course, on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extent of those downturns. In cards specifically, as you say, in any one period of growth or a downturn, you could see an increase in reserve expense that we're taking, life of loan versus the next 9 or 12 months, so that's true. And then on the Wholesale side, you could see some differences, of course, because there are modeling differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through-the-cycle. Having said that, we continue [to think that] incremental volatility would be material for us. And of course, net charge-offs are not changing. And then from a pricing perspective, we don't foresee in the near term any pricing changes. The cash flows with the customer have not changed. And so we don't see any. But it is true, as you rightly point out, that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that we're taking reserves upfront versus through time. So over time, you could see that, but we're not expecting it in the near term.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: They could be, of course. So that's just timing. Particularly on the card side, it's just timing. But it's difficult to know, again, because it relies on our ability to have perfect foresight into the timing and extent of a downturn.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So you're talking about markets, Erika?
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. Okay, sure. So there -- at Goldman in early December, I did say we expected to be up meaningfully. I would say the performance was broad-based. In rates, we call out securitized products -- I'm sorry, in Fixed Income, we call out securitized products and rates, which were bright spots. But broadly speaking, obviously, Equity's had a very strong quarter as well. So it's really across the franchise. And we saw very strong client flow and we had success monetizing those flows. So just a very healthy environment for us and really strong performance.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: So look, on the efficiency ratio, I would say that like we run the company with great discipline, whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle. But because the efficiency ratio is an outcome, not an input, and it's about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any 1 year. We think about operating leverage over time. And as we always say, we're not going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds. And on expenses, I would just say that at Investor Day last year, Marianne told you that we expected the cost curve to flatten post-2019. In 2019, adjusted expenses were up 3%. 2020, we expect them to be up less than that.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: He is.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes, he is. Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure, of course. So I think you can think about tech spending on a fully loaded basis being in line with what I described for the company. And we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech, but as you well know, we continuously invest in tech. And so there's a fair amount of velocity in the investment portfolio there as investments roll off. And we're investing in new technology and innovation. So you can think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how I described the company in terms of trend.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So I mean we're bound by standardized capital. And so of course, that is a consideration for us and one of the reasons that we're looking to structure loan sales as you described in the mortgage business. So we think that there's more we can do there. And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the Fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult. So both are at the margin constraints for us. But broadly speaking, I wouldn't say that we're constrained given where we are on our capital ratios.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So we -- I think we ended up at the low end as we, through the year, continued to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like. And so I think that's really what's driving it. Obviously portfolio mix as well continued to be very strong in terms of performance of the portfolio. And then on the estimates for the economic outlook. As you rightly say, there is the reasonable and supportable period, which for us, is 2 years. And so we do use multiple weighted scenarios there. So we weigh multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight, and that's where you end up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period, which also obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's a great point, Jamie, I should have said that. Yes, we -- I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q for the first quarter.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Right.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right. So you'll see more in the Qs.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So the first quarter tend to be a bit higher for us, if you look through history. And so -- but there, you can think about it comparing it year-over-year, we have volume and revenue-related expenses increasing, a bit of an increase on investment, but both are being partially offset by expense efficiencies.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on that ratio, just remind you that, of course, we have our capital distribution plan approved once a year. And so since our last CCAR filing, we have realized some RWA efficiency and we've outearned relative to the assumptions in the CCAR filing. And so that's part of the reason why we've seen the ratios load up there. On stock buybacks, as you rightly point out, our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic growth, and so we are always looking to do that first and foremost. And then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend. And only then, to distribute excess capital to shareholders through buybacks. And we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above 2x tangible book, which is about where we are now. We will obviously, when distributing excess capital, always be looking at the alternatives. But at 17% ROTCE and 2% or 3% dividend payout ratio, there is a high bar to the alternatives.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: That's right. WePay last year. Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So on Wholesale nonperforming loans, in the CIB, that was some name-specific upgrades that we had in the CIB. And then in the Commercial Bank, that was related to charge-offs taken in the quarter. And then on energy, really nothing there, statically, I would say. Like any sector, we have upgrades and downgrades and this quarter was no exception. But I wouldn't say anything thematically in our portfolio that we're concerned about.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. We give a lot of thought to it. And I agree, it is a high-class problem. And so we've said that at or above 2x tangible book makes sense. If it continues to go up, we're going to continue to look at alternatives, most importantly, within the company, in terms of how we should really think about the returns on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit differently in terms of organic growth. Jamie, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Thanks, Steven. So you touched on a number of things that are all important. And I think what's most important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them. The comments from the Vice Chair have been constructive, in the sense that he always reiterates that he thinks the level of capital in the system is about right. And so we'll have a firmer view when we see a final rule. As you say, we do expect to see something in 2020 based upon the comments that we have heard, just like you have. And we expect that our 12% target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the Vice Chair say over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right. And then -- but we can't have a certain view until we see the final rule. And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we're going to see the refinements that the Fed has been talking about, perhaps not full recalibration until Basel IV, which is what the Vice Chair recently said. But certainly, there are a number of refinements that we've been talking about, and the Fed has been talking about, for years. And that we remain hopeful that we'll see them very soon.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So you're absolutely right. On the Wholesale side, the Fed balance sheet expansion was for sure a tailwind for us. Although I would say the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the Wholesale side in the quarter was from strong organic growth and client acquisition. (technical difficulty) [Pension] was a tailwind. And elsewhere, I would say obviously, it was the right thing to do and provided stability in the [retail] markets throughout the quarter.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure, sure, Brian. So I'll start with retail, where we saw rates paid tick up a bit, and that's on migration from savings to CDs. We have seen CD pricing come off its peak, but continued migration from savings to CDs. And then on the Wholesale side, you see bigger declines in rates paid in Treasury Services for sure, and then a little bit less so in the Commercial Bank and AWM. And again, as we always say, these are name-specific, client-by-client decisions. And while we feel good about where we are, these are decisions we make client-by-client, and we're certainly careful and have a lot of discipline, not going to lose valuable relationships over a few ticks of beta.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So there are obviously some puts and takes, which I'll run through. But broadly speaking, I would say what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand. And in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused in specialized industries and market expansion. But of course, that's offset partly by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off. And then in CRE, good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there, given the rate environment. And then that is offset by real estate banking, where we are very disciplined, given where we are in the cycle.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. I mean there, I would say, Glenn, our customers' data privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. And we think, over time, the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have third-party apps only access data through our APIs. And so we are working name-by-name to get those agreements in place. And we hope through time, that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our customers' data. We think that's the most secure way to do it.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Great point. And we're going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. You can imagine a dashboard where they will have the...
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. There -- I wouldn't say there's anything permanent there. The first quarter is typically lower for us, Marty. You can think about full year '20 as being 20%, plus or minus. And of course, that would depend on any nonrecurring items we might have or any change in regulation. But 20%, plus or minus. And then of course the managed tax rate is typically 500 to 700 basis points higher than that.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes. So there, I would say, Marty, on the sort of the last several hikes, there was some catch-up there because we know we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment. So if you're just looking at the last few hikes, the betas would certainly be higher than what we're seeing in terms of the first 3 eases here. But broadly speaking on NIM, I mean, we don't -- NIM is an outcome for us, not an input. And as we think about looking forward, certainly, the environment is very competitive. It always has been. And NII, the outlook for 2020 is, at this point, based upon the implieds, flat to slightly down, and we do expect balance sheet growth.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: I would say, Andrew, that it was broad-based. We can have Jason and team follow-up specifically on a geographic breakdown, but it was largely broad-based.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Again, I don't have the split on market share by region, but Jason and the team can certainly follow up on that.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Yes.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Sure. So as you said, we'll give you more color at Investor Day. For the Treasury Services business, we feel really good about where we're positioned. But I think going forward, there will obviously be some rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth. But given the investments that we have made there, Jamie mentioned InstaMed earlier, we feel really good about the capabilities that we're adding and what we're seeing in terms of organic growth there. But we can talk to you more about that at Investor Day.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Okay. Thanks, everyone.
JENNIFER A. PIEPSZAK: Okay. See you tomorrow.",0.25,-0.4210000000000009,0,0.13565166536156298,0.14934531761097894
34,Q1_2011,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & COMPANY: A little of all -- each.
JAMIE DIMON: It's just more client-related business. We accrue higher client-related business.
JAMIE DIMON: No. So in terms of the capital and the risk weighted assets already represent in effect Basel very close to -- or at least our best estimates of Basel III. And while it's possible some people are doing less long tail derivative stuff, I would not put it in a material category. This is a lot of client volume, a lot of client flow, lot of activity.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I'll answer this question, but then you've got to let someone else ask a question, okay, Guy? So first of all, if you look at deposits, okay, Middle-Market -- I mean, Commercial Bank deposits are way up, TSS deposits are way up, Private Bank deposits are way up, Retail deposits are up. Clients have a lot of money and they're investing a lot and, as you know, we keep the benefit. There's a lot of money washed around the world and obviously we're a beneficiary of some of that. You can see it by business if you go in deeper to the supplement.
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks, Guy.
JAMIE DIMON: The reserve -- look, obviously the reserves are coming down over time precisely because of what you mentioned. The reserves are based on a forward-looking view of charge-offs. As charge-offs come down the reserve will come down. And eventually they'll be the same. If you're reserving effectively for 12 months of losses and things are steady eventually they'll be the same. A normalized charge-off ratio will eventually be 4.5%, that's through-the-cycle, to be obviously lower than that or higher than that.
JAMIE DIMON: And it does not include any related penalties.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, because a lot of things are running through RWA, but I think what we said last time is that mitigation -- most of which, not all of which, most of which will happen by the end of this year was $[150] billion of risk weighted assets?
JAMIE DIMON: And that's all things being equal, which they're not.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not going to do it and lose money.
JAMIE DIMON: We can only buy back $8 billion of stock according to the guidelines from the Fed. We are going to buy back, regardless of price, $3 billion which is what we issue -- or approximately what we issue every year for stock-related compensation. And the other part is discretionary, we're not going to automatically do it. It will be price-sensitive and if we build up excess capital so be it.
JAMIE DIMON: You also know the final Basel III guidelines we have to hold to. I mean, we think 7% is plenty, but that may not be the final guideline.
JAMIE DIMON: I would assume that's going to happen because there's almost very little we can do to stop it.
JAMIE DIMON: (Multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: I don't (inaudible).
JAMIE DIMON: I think we said the $40 billion anticipates the IB being at 8%; we're assuming some mitigation here in the IB kind of by the end of the year on a stand-alone basis. So -- and remember, that balance sheet of $250 billion or so was very, very short-term liquid stuff. So the adjusted asset is like [600] and the equity is 40.
JAMIE DIMON: So I think the baseline Basel stuff is attempting to be a global agreement to have a level playing field for everybody. There are some flaws with that, which are also in my letter, because there are different laws now in the United States regarding derivatives, Volcker, the uses of preferred dividends, etc. But I think it's an attempt by regulators to have a global agreement. Each country is going to set its own what they call the SIFI or global SIFI surcharge. So each country can do something in addition to the 7%, but I personally don't think that because the UK and Switzerland do it that the United States should feel like it has to do it. I mean each country is a slightly different thing. In Switzerland, their bank is dwarfed at the size of their economy. That's not true here. I also have a chart in my show letter about that. So there are other reasons why other countries might go to higher ratios.
JAMIE DIMON: The United States should do what's good for the United States, not what's good for Europe.
JAMIE DIMON: I believe we'll get more guidance maybe sometime late this summer.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, honestly, if it is just a little bit more, no. If it is a lot more, probably. And we are going to have to wait and see. I also think it is very important, after you think about it a little bit, the market is going to price things. Just because a bank holds 10% doesn't mean the market is going to affect use 10% to price something. So your competitive market is going to be based upon something different. So it's hard to figure out exactly what that means. My attitude would be we'd run the businesses at a 7% or 8% Basel III and hold the excess at Corporate.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, no, I actually think there is an intelligent thought about having it different for performing versus defaulted loans. It is far more expensive to default a loan. So the devil is in the detail, but it's a good thought, a good concept and in general, it would eventually reduce the size of the MSR, which would be fine with us too.
JAMIE DIMON: It really depends how the whole mortgage business turns out. I mean we've really got to wait and see what the future liabilities are for future mortgage origination, etc. before you decide to do something like that.
JAMIE DIMON: We think the skin-in-the-game concept is a good idea. We think that it would be fine with us. It has a lot of consequences, but we would be fine with that. And the QRM; either way it can work as long it is all properly designed. So we don't really have an ax in this fight about how it is going to take place, but we just hope that however it takes place is really well thought through and we would be happy to work with people to help to try to make sure that is done.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but balance sheet intensive wouldn't bother us if they're good assets.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, we really do this by business, but you had a chart, Doug, that you showed me that showed --. In fact, if you look at IB comp, back that out and you look at the overhead --.
JAMIE DIMON: But it's a little elevated this quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: But backing that out there is other expense that is modestly --.
JAMIE DIMON: Eventually overhead expense from default and foreclosure REO will probably drop $300 million or $400 million a quarter. And that's not including repurchased stuff which is another couple hundred million dollars a quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, as you talk about number for us, it's now going to be north of $1 billion. And I think last year it was $800 million, so I think it may be $500 million more than it used to be.
JAMIE DIMON: I kind of object to how they went about that and so there will be more conversations about how those charges go through. The FDIC was supposed to be deposit insurance. And remember, we pay for the deposit insurance. JPMorgan paid as a government guaranteed and it's a government program paid for by banks. So we'll have paid through this crisis about $5 billion of FDIC. But this is going to increase that for us.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, because we had two books of business that are kind of running off -- running down, WaMu and some of this balance transfer stuff. And we actually had broken that out in an earlier presentation too. And those predominately will be completed by the third quarter. So there we just know we're getting stable kind of balances.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a lot of different things, but remember we -- some thing -- there was some repricing, but it's also run-off of low return balance transfers. So there's a lot of things in there.
JAMIE DIMON: It will generally head up a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: Fairly uniform.
JAMIE DIMON: I wrote about this a little bit in my Chairman's letter. Look, the government laid out three kinds of baseline ways to set up the GSEs and the mortgage markets. And one of the points we've made is whichever one happens, we all agree it should protect the taxpayer, that we want a healthy mortgage market, but it has to be designed properly. Any one of the three could actually work to do those things. And I think that's one of the reasons the Treasury laid it out is so you could have a conversation and response and think through the effect on the markets, how quickly you can do it. Obviously there's a lot of politics around the GSE, so hopefully we'll have a really good healthy mortgage market when it's said and done. A healthy mortgage market means it's got to be good for consumers and it's got to be good for investors, otherwise you will not have a healthy mortgage market.
JAMIE DIMON: (Multiple speakers) like most of the big transactions.
JAMIE DIMON: And some of the smaller (multiple speakers) not having a balance sheet is helping them. So it's both.
JAMIE DIMON: I wouldn't be looking for a dividend increase if I were you the next couple of quarters. But the regulators have made it clear that -- which I think is a reasonable thing that you have quarterly stress tests and stuff like that. We would have permission to do more on the deal if we wanted to, a little bit more. But at one point we would obviously go ask them in this environment.
JAMIE DIMON: Sure. The answer is yes, but you also have all these new accounting laws and rules and stuff like that. So we believe a strong reserve is a good thing to have an unquestioned balance sheet.
JAMIE DIMON: This quarter is 35 and last quarter was what --?
JAMIE DIMON: Just middle-market.
JAMIE DIMON: It was a little bit less.
JAMIE DIMON: No, because it's not a relevant figure for large Corporate because large companies can access bonds, loans, bilaterals, they go in and out for a whole bunch of different reasons, so we don't really actually track it.
JAMIE DIMON: It's fine.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't -- again, the backlog itself is a very volatile number. And there are a lot of things that are being worked on that are not on the backlog. So the flow of business looks good. And that's -- it looks like it's going to be fine. Companies are pretty active financing and --.
JAMIE DIMON: Last quarter the middle-market utilization was 34.1.
JAMIE DIMON: If this number is right.
JAMIE DIMON: That is more relevant than some of the other ones. The other ones bounce around a lot.
JAMIE DIMON: There's not [non-business].
JAMIE DIMON: (multiple speakers) billion, Middle-Market is up a couple of -- $3 billion. So that's across the whole spectrum of businesses.
JAMIE DIMON: Predominately it's only in the IB and not a lot, maybe $1 billion or $2 billion, but it wouldn't be a lot.
JAMIE DIMON: It's mostly other banks, but there are other buyers in there, certain funds and investors who also buy.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I would say we're doing covenant-lite deals uniquely. I think covenants have gotten lighter as lending has eased a little bit. But again, if you're looking at it for the country it's probably a pretty good thing. I don't think it's gotten to the point where you would look at it as it was like it was in the summer of '07.
JAMIE DIMON: And also covenant-lite is only one factor. You can have covenant-lite and great credit. To me it's really the credit, the deal, the leverage, not just the covenant.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, but you've got to look at both sides of the balance sheet here, because we have a lot of deposits, which when we get the deposit obviously we invest it. So I would say it's largely related to both the deposits and then our own -- how we want to manage the interest rate exposure to the Company. And remember, it's costing us money how we're managing the interest rate exposure to the Company. And some of that product that's in the CIO portfolio -- a lot of -- I forgot the exact number -- a lot of it what I call spread product, it's like zero duration but it's got a spread in it to protect us from rising rates.
JAMIE DIMON: I think if you look at Corporate, Mid-Corporate, Middle-Market and even small business, they're generally across-the-board stronger than they were. And that's -- anecdotally it's surveys, it's capital, it's cash, it's deposits, it's lending conditions, financial conditions. So you're seeing confidence come back. Obviously laying on top of that a little bit is -- with some of these things happening around the world from Europe to Middle East and Japan, but it's not clear that's going to derail these companies going about their business, hiring people and even small business demand. Small business loans were flat for our total Company quarter over quarter, but this quarter is generally a very low quarter. So it's a very good sign in our opinion. We're starting to see real small business loan demand.
JAMIE DIMON: And I assume we're going to see that with the competitors too by the way, that that's not just us.
JAMIE DIMON: Most things are better than they were a year ago; even the bad things are better than they were a year ago.
JAMIE DIMON: So we pointed out mortgage losses were -- we were losing $2 billion a quarter in charge-offs and mortgages. It's now down to $1.1 billion. And remember, the early signs of delinquencies will drive foreclosures six months, 12 months from now. In other words, those are going to start coming down at one point later in the year, early in 2012, not go up. That's a good sign not a bad sign -- even though they're still very elevated right now.
JAMIE DIMON: Before we do that, we're going to -- we're thinking about hiring Deutsche Bank to help us in our capital structure here in the United States.
JAMIE DIMON: Markets, credit, FX, rates.
JAMIE DIMON: Just put aside for the second spreads and put aside for a second how good you are at trading, the underlying growth is going to be pretty good. If you look at global capital flows, global network, global balance sheets, the growth of multinationals, the need for FX, the need for trade, the need for -- the underlying number is actually pretty good over a decade. I mean, you can -- any one quarter you could be dramatically different because the spreads -- how you're actually trading them and -- but I would say it's a pretty -- the needs of investors are going to grow a lot over the next 10 to 20 years, not a little.
JAMIE DIMON: And that includes corporations, governments, super nationals, sovereign wealth funds -- when I actually talk about some of these flows over the next 10 or 15 years.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so the portfolio we have obviously move around, it's also global, okay. And I think I just mentioned we went to more spread product than -- and we invested more money and we have a lot of mortgages. So 2.89%, you can go buy mortgages at far higher rates than that. We also put on some prime, like $2 billion of prime jumbos coming out of the private bank at much higher rates. So we can give you a better answer than that. But I think it's just those things I just mentioned.
JAMIE DIMON: I think Doug answered -- the underlying trend is down a little bit, but obviously we could make big decisions that change that very quickly. And if rates go up our NIM could actually expand a little bit, which is not -if you look at the implied curve, that's not going to happen right away. But if it does happen we'll -- our NIM will actually go up, not down.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't know yet because these are all just proposals out there. And the proposals are different for consumer, for defaulted, for wholesale. So -- but I hope when it's said and done you have a better matching and less [post of totality], it will be more countercyclical will be my hope.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so I think Doug mentioned it will be lumpy, but we like lumpy as long as there's 20% average. And I think our folks, particularly One Equity Partners have done more than that over time. So yes, we hope -- we're optimistic but we don't count on it.
JAMIE DIMON: We tell them to just run your businesses, make your investments and when you want to do what's right for the investment do it then, don't worry about the timing or the Company. But, yes, we expect profits from them over time.
JAMIE DIMON: It was one big restructuring.
JAMIE DIMON: But I think a lot of the headcount add quarter-over-quarter is because of adding salespeople and branches.
JAMIE DIMON: Mostly it's a reduction in the portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: A little bit because we already gave them some credit for that number.
JAMIE DIMON: Basically the bottom -- the baseline assumption should be we're going to run these businesses 7% Basel III and the IB a little bit higher. That's the bottom line assumption. Sometimes we give them a little benefit for mitigation that we know is going to take place or something like that, but that's the bottom.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess you have to, right? I mean -- you're not going to price to lose, you're going to price to win the business and the market sets the price and if the mortgage is usually a 7% capital set price, then that's the cap you're going to use to set price, regardless of whether you're hold a little bit more or not, that was really my whole point.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not going to comment on that because all I know is what I read in the paper this morning too. The other one is I guess you've got to look at regulation. We always believed in higher cap and higher liquidity. And the regulators are talking about a level playing field and I understand that the risk weighted asset calculations aren't done the same everywhere. So they say the bill makes sure that they incorporate that in their thinking. That's not the only -- you've got to look at all of it. If American banks can't have tax-deductible preferreds and overseas banks can, well that's one thing. American banks have to demand margin from end-users, which I'm not sure is going to be the case, from non-financial -and use the derivatives, well the business will go elsewhere. So we just want to make sure it's fair in total, including SIFI charges, because if every country does that differently, that may not be fair either. So to me -- I think the regulators and the government officials do say they want to have a level playing field. But why was MSR deducted from capital? It's a perfectly good asset. Why would that be a deduction directly from capital but not plant and equipment or some other assets or highly liquid loans? Why is -- the Eximbank treated differently than super national things are treated overseas? So when you dig into it there are a lot of things in here that just -- they need to be clarified and cleaned up. I think people want to do that and obviously the banks have to run a business. And I would also point out, by the way, when America was still in Basel I, when the rest of the world was in Basel II, it didn't hurt us to be in Basel I. So you don't have to have exactly the same stuff either to have -- to be able to compete.
JAMIE DIMON: You've exhausted us, folks. Thank you (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: We'll talk to you all soon.",0.1200000000000001,-0.16697999999999966,0,0.11143855151156346,0.14132541790821013
35,Q4_2018,"
MARIANNE LAKE, EXECUTIVE VP & CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported fourth quarter net income of $7.1 billion and EPS of $1.98 on revenue of nearly $27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remained solid, including core loans and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, capital market activity and with credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses. For the full year of 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income of $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform. And so we're entering 2019 with good momentum across our businesses. Turning to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $26.8 billion was up $1.1 billion or 4% year-on-year, driven by net interest income. NII was up $1.2 billion or 9% on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was down slightly, with lower market levels impacting Asset Wealth Management fees and Private Equity losses being offset by higher Card fees and Auto lease growth in CCB. Expense of $15.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year. The increase related to investments we are making in technology, marketing, real estate and front office as well as revenue-related costs, including growth in Auto. This was partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fees. As we had hoped, the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective the end of the third quarter, and this is a benefit of a little over $200 million for the quarter across our businesses. Credit trends remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $240 million year-on-year, driven by changes in reserves. In Consumer, we built reserves of $150 million in Cards on loan growth. In Wholesale, over the last several quarters, we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries. However, this quarter, we had about $200 million of credit costs. Again, largely reserve builds on select C&I client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors. While we are constantly looking at the granular level [for shadows], these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolio. The outlook for credit as we see it remains positive. Shifting to the full year results on Page 3. We reported net income for the year of $32.5 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 17% and EPS of $9 a share. Net income was a record for the firm as well as for each of our businesses, even excluding tax reform. Revenue of $111.5 billion is also a record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and card margin expansion being offset by lower-market NII. Noninterest revenue was up $2.5 billion or 5%, driven by CIB Markets and growth in Consumer, being offset by Private Equity losses and the impact of spread widening on FCA. We ended the year with adjusted expense at $63.3 billion, up 6%, which brings our overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember, our revenues were impacted by lower growth starts given tax reform. Adjusted for this or looking on a GAAP basis, we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter. On credit, the environment remained favorable throughout 2018. Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8%, driven by lower net reserve build in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales. Moving on to Page 4 and balance sheet and capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12%, flat to last quarter. Risk-weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading RWA, given a combination of seasonality, market conditions and model enhancements. Our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100%, and we repurchased $5.7 billion of shares. Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on Page 5. CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30% for the fourth quarter and, for the year, nearly $15 billion of net income and an ROE of 28%. Customer satisfaction remains near all-time highs across our businesses. For the quarter, core loans were up 5% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 8%; Cards, up 6%; and Business Banking, up 5%. Deposits grew 3%. Growth continues to slow given the rising rate environment, but importantly, we believe we continue to outpace the industry. Of note, this quarter, we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets, including D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. And although it's clearly early, reception in the market and the performance of the new branches have been strong. Despite volatile markets, client investment assets were still up 3%. And we saw record net new money flows for the year. Card sales were up 10%, debit sales up 11% and merchant processing volume is up 17%, reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. And in keeping with our focus on digital everything, of note, active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11% year-on-year. Revenue of $13.7 billion was up 13%. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 18% on higher deposit NII, driven by margin expansion. Home Lending revenue was down 8%, driven by lower net production revenue in a low volume, highly competitive environment. And of note, while not a material driver of overall expense, revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense. And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14%, driven by higher Card NII on both loan growth and margin expansion, lower card net acquisition costs, principally Sapphire Reserve, and higher Auto lease volumes. Card revenue rate was 11.6% for the quarter and 11.27% for the year as expected. Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6%, driven by investments in technology and marketing and Auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies. On credit, net charge-offs were down $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in Card were more than offset by lower charge-offs in Auto and Home Lending. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across all portfolios. Economic indicators remain upbeat, and given the breadth and depth of our franchise, we have a pretty good barometer. From everything we see, the U.S. consumer remains very healthy. Now turning to Page 6 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion and an ROE of 10% on revenue of $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $12 billion and an ROE of 16%. In banking, it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees. We ranked #1 in Global IB fees for the 10th consecutive year, gaining share across all regions. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3%. We saw continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38%, driven by the closing of several large transactions. For the year, we ranked #2 in wallet gaining share. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% but significantly outperforming the market. We ranked #1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally, with particular strength in IPOs as well as in the technology and health care sectors. And debt underwriting fees were down 19% versus a strong prior year and secular market. We maintained our #1 brand rank for the year and continues to hold strong lead-left positions in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and a slight off margin loan loss last year. A confluence of factors throughout the quarter, including trade, concerns around global growth and corporate earnings, fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility, which were amplified by [markets' bad debts and] liquidity. And although we saw decent client flow, rates rallied, spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly, all against general market condition that was anticipating a strong end to the year. As a result, Fixed Income Markets, in particular, were challenging, with revenue down 18% adjusted. Weaker performance across Rates, Credit Trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets. Equities revenue was up 2% adjusted, a solid end to a record year. Prime continued to do well, but we saw clients deleveraging over the course of the quarter, and cash and derivatives were solid in the tougher environment. Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefiting from fee growth on higher volumes. Securities Services revenue was $1 billion, up 1%. Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates, together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $243 million, reflecting higher funding spreads on our derivatives. Finally, expense of $4.7 billion was up slightly, with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume-related transaction costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges and lower performance-based compensation. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28%. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7. The Commercial Bank reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, $4 billion of net income and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter was down 2% as the prior year included a tax reform-related benefit. Excluding this, revenue was up 3%, driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $600 million was down 1% year-on-year but up 4% sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity, particularly in M&A. Full year IB revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 4% on strong activity across segments, in particular, middle market banking, which was up 8%. Deposit balances were up 1% sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest towards year-end, although down 7% year-on-year, as we continued to see migrations of nonoperating deposits to higher-yielding alternatives. We believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows. Expense of $845 million was down 7% year-on-year as the prior year included $100 million of impairment on leased assets. Excluding this, expense was up 5%, driven by continued investments in the business, in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives. Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 1%, reflecting a decline in our tax-exempt portfolio, given tax reform. Adjusting for this, we would have been up 4%, which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection, pricing and credit discipline. But keep in mind in areas where we have chosen to grow, such as in our expansion market, we are growing at or above industry benchmarks. CRE loans were up 2%, also below the industry, as we've proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in the cycle through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selection of new deals. Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs of $106 million, including higher loan loss reserves, largely due to select client downgrades. Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $604 million, with a pretax margin of 23% and an ROE of 26% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $3 billion, pretax margin at 26% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.4 billion for the quarter was down 5% year-on-year, with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as, to a lesser extent, lower performance fees. These were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows. Expense of $2.6 billion was flat as continued investment in advisers and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees. For the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $3 billion, with strength in Fixed Income more than offset by outflows from equity and multiasset products. Additionally, we had net liquidity inflows of $21 billion. For the 10th consecutive year, we saw net long-term inflows of $25 billion this year, driven predominantly by multiasset and, in addition, saw $31 billion of net liquidity inflow this year. Assets under management of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were both down 2% as the impact of market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows. Deposits were flat sequentially and down 7% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments, and we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows. Finally, we had record loan balances up 13% with strength in global Wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to Page 9 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $577 million. Treasury and CIO net income of $175 million was up year-on-year, primarily driven by higher rates. Other Corporate saw a net loss of $752 million, including on a pretax basis, funding of our foundation, the corporate philanthropy, $200 million this quarter, flat year-on-year, and including $150 million of markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments, market-related. The remainder is driven by tax-related items totaling a little over $300 million. And within this, there are 2 notable components. The first is regular weighted tax reserves, and the second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each of our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year. So therefore, there is an offset across our businesses. Our full year effective tax rate was just a little over 20%, in line with guidance. Moving to Page 10 and outlook. We will give you more full year outlook and sensitivity information at Investor Day as always. However, for now, I did want to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. Net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth. But quarter-over-quarter, we'll be negatively impacted by day count, and we expect the first quarter NII to be relatively flat sequentially. While it's too clearly -- too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues, it's also fair to say that this quarter, markets feel calmer and more positive, and Capital Markets' pipelines are strong. So if the environment remains supportive, we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter. But I will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a $500 million accounting write-off as well as broad strength in performance. Expect expense to be up mid-single digits year-on-year, obviously, market-dependent, primarily annualization effects. And finally, as I said, we expect credit to remain favorable across products. So to close, while the Markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not lose sight of the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed, a record for revenue, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform. Fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth, and we're generally constructive on the outlook for 2019. We have good momentum coming into the year, and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned. With that, operator, we can open up the lines to Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say a couple of things. The first is just to remind you that '17 and '18, I would look at our GAAP rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform. So -but that said, we have -- while we don't set expense targets nor do we set overhead ratio targets, we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that a combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, notwithstanding the investments that we've been making, we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid-50s, so 55-ish percent. Obviously, the timing of that will depend on rates in Markets and everything else. So we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher NII, on growth, if nothing else, and continued solid growth in fees. Clearly, in any 1 quarter, you can have pluses and minuses that can be market-dependent, but generally, over time, we would still expect those trends.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say, first of all, just to say that the question mark about whether that's a pause or a stop, is it the end of a cycle, we don't think so. We think the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong. The consumer's still strong and healthy, and we're expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward. Having said that, just as a general matter, you've seen through our earnings at risk that as we have put more and more of the benefit of past rate hikes in our run rate, each incremental hike from here has, whilst it's still positive, significantly lower sort of incremental NII drive, and that the front end skew is a lower percentage. So it's not nothing, but clearly, lower front-end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve, all other things would be, net, modestly negative. But against that, you kind of pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice. And so as the Fed pauses, it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or not. We would still look at -- we've delivered $4.3 billion of NII growth in 2018. We'll still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates we've already had as well as solid growth. So while you can't expect 2019 over '18 to be at that level, it would still be strong NII growth year-on-year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. And if this were the end of a cycle, it's no cycle we've ever seen before. So in that scenario, if terminal Fed fund rates are 2.5% -- no, 4.5%, 5%-plus, I think we've never seen that movie before, but that's not our central case. And by the way, the House did a research view. We'd still need to see incremental hikes this year, if not in the first half, in the second.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I would say that when we think about the product, continuing what we have in the construct, rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers. Customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product, value and simplicity and ease of use, are the 3 things in the products that we deliver. And so for us, engaged relationships drive profitability. This is still a very profitable business. And so while we'll always make adjustments to our offerings, it's not the case that we are looking at a meaningful pullback in rewards. And if you think about things like Sapphire Banking, where we're looking to bring the impact of our products together, we're continuing to offer rewards-based incentives to drive engagement with our customers. So we think it's a solid strategy, a business that already has good returns. It's fair to say that we've seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving higher rewards offerings too, and we've not seen that lower our ability to net acquire new accounts. So we feel great about the value proposition, the simplicity and the compelling products that we have.
MARIANNE LAKE: By the way, it's a very profitable business.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think that the macro trends are definitely positive, so they are creating tailwinds. But it's also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014, '15 that we had expanded our credit box, we had expanded it intentionally at higher risk-adjusted margins. But over the course of the last couple of years as we've experienced outperformance, we've done sort of surgical risk pullbacks, and we've amended our collection strategy, all of which have led to a charge-off rate for the fourth quarter in '18 that's down slightly year-on-year and for the year, that's at 310 basis points, which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations even as late as the end of last year. So we feel great that, that kind of loss trend at that 310, maybe a little bit higher, is something we should look forward to, at least into 2019, and it will be helped by a supportive macro environment. And we are seeing -- if you unpick all of our trends, you see the phenomenon of 3 vintages. You'd see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates. You'd see the older expansion vintages that have passed their peak delinquencies that are trending to a more stable lower level. And then you do have, obviously, with new acquisitions, a cohort that are still seasoning. That will continue, but net-net, we're expecting relatively stable loss rates at levels similar to 2018.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sure, okay. So I would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging, and there was a lot of market moves, a big sort of broad sell off. And at that point, there were elevated concerns around trade, global growth beta was causing concerns. There were concerns that the Fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about. So there were a lot of negativity, we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter. And it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment print, which reminded people that there's a very long distance between 3% growth and a contraction. So yes, we could see slower growth but still growth in the U.S. and across the globe. A slightly more constructive narrative on trade, and that continues to broadly progress, we hope and believe, in a positive direction. A more dovish outlook from the Fed, the potential for there to be pauses in rates, all being relatively supportive. And the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter, and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found. So I would say just early days in the first quarter. There are still, obviously, risks to the outlook. And any of those things could go in a worse direction. But so far, things just feel a little bit more positive, and that's constructive. And therefore, you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in January. On leveraged loans, look, so let's just start diving into the sort of potential for there to be hung bridges. It's true, that there was a significant market correction with spreads widening across high-yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter. Clearly -- stepping back, while the industry leveraged finance commitments are up, they are materially down from before the crisis, and very different. So credit fundamentals look pretty good. Having said that -- and by the way, we passed on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter. We've maintained our sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protections. And as a result, the more maturity of our bridge book has still got decent cushion. And that's not to say that there's no deal that have the potential for there to be net losses after fees, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter. I would also say that coming back to the third quarter that, actually, the market could be quite constructive for Fixed Income into the third quarter, given a more dovish spread, supporting corporate margins, corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low, and we do have time. So none of the deals that we have need to be brought to market in a hurry, and the market is moving in a positive direction.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's no good of a conserve, talking about how we think things are going to pan out in the first quarter, other than just the general comments I've already made, which is the environment should be more constructive, and we are expecting decent volatility and client activity. And we'll see how that pans out. With respect to emerging markets, Latin America was a big piece but Asia, too.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: In '19, we'll gain share.
MARIANNE LAKE: And we take the same position. Like, we had strong first half of the year. And we said, long may it continue, but it may not, and 1 quarter doesn't make a trend. And so we don't really react to the sort of micro even though it was driven by the macro. The real underlying business drivers continue to be strong. And even in those businesses, we are holding leadership positions and gaining share. And so this too will pass, and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. We're not expecting anything to be elevated.
MARIANNE LAKE: No.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So it's internal, and it's like 5 names, 4 sectors. We know the specifics. It is situationally specific. Remember, just to give you some context, while those can drive the dollar value, in a regular way in any quarter, given the size of our portfolio, we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances. And so when we say that we're looking at this and saying that things are idiosyncratic, it's not just looking at the 5 situations that drive the biggest dollar value. It's also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and the hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there's any trends or net worrying signs there and, honestly, not now. And so if anything, marginally, we had more upgrades. But it's just there's nothing to see right now in our portfolios, and we're looking.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Only the paranoid survive. We're more paranoid than you are.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right. The plumbing was working. We didn't see any sort of algo or technology issues. We didn't see any volumes that couldn't be coped with. While I said that there was a little bit of a lack of debt for the Markets and liquidity, that's typically the case when you'd have one-way trends in a market and a lot of people similarly situated. So I would say that relatively functioned well but challenging.
MARIANNE LAKE: There were no marks. In our bridge book right now, we have, for the vast majority, we have good cushion. And we expect to be able to clear and price through the market. And for anything that's even borderline, it's completely not material.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: I mean, there was an uptick at the end of the year. You saw it in the industry data. We saw it in our spot data. For us, in fact, it was largely driven by 1 investment-grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter. But there was a little bit of an uptick, a little bit more in terms of average advancing on the balance sheet, but nothing I would call...
MARIANNE LAKE: No. Nothing that I would call unusual or a trend. We didn't have to take down things that would've otherwise not cleared the market.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say, first of all, that you saw that from 2013 through '16, we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses. So in terms of the low-hanging fruit and things like that, we would say largely that's been harvested. We are always looking to generate core operating efficiency, so that we can absorb growth. And when we are investing in technology data, one of the reasons to do it, customer satisfaction, product innovation aside, is for efficiencies. So we are seeing some of that come through. We'll continue to drive that down.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right.
MARIANNE LAKE: And the way I would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline. But as long as you feel, as we do, that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we're making, which we think are strategically important to the long-term growth of the company and the profitability of the company, supporting our clients, if those are good decisions for long-term growth, while we could obviously make changes, we would not look to do that. And so marketing expense, for example, is one area where you would say there is pretty sizable and immediate flexibility, nevertheless, when we invest in marketing, we're driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long-term growth. So we invested through the cycle. We think it sort of differentiates our long-term performance, and we'd like to continue to do that. 2019 over '18, you wouldn't expect to see necessarily the same clip-ups that you saw last year. We did accelerate investments in '18. So more of the growth will be revenue-related but still decent investments and the opportunity still good to do that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry, keep going.
MARIANNE LAKE: So first of all, I just want to sort of point out that in the Cards space, we hope we continue to grow healthy mid-single digits. There's seasonality to Cards' balances and losses, so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year. That's what we saw this year and, actually, a little bit lower year-on-year than last. And in the Wholesale space, you're going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic, given the nature of the loans that we have. I wouldn't necessarily say that we expect to see a trend of significant reserves, but we've been flattered by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years, partly or in large part, at least earlier, releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn. And so we'll have some downgrades. We might have some releases. I would, net-net, think that as we grow, we would build but not disproportionally. And remember, we're arguably at the best point in the cycle. So Jamie mentioned it earlier, to the degree that we have the flexibility, we are making sure that we're reserved accordingly.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I mean, I think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data, which is still generally supportive, and say things should be good. But for sure, investments is not immune to external factors. And so manufacturing data has been a little weaker. I would say, CapEx is sluggish on fears around global growth. Government shutdown and trade are not particularly helpful. Uncertainty is not good for anyone. So there's no doubt that as things continue, if there's a level of anxiety and uncertainty, it's just not constructive for confidence, and confidence begets stronger or less strong markets. So I wouldn't say that I think it's clear and present danger, but I think we should be extremely careful because sentiment, particularly consumer sentiment, will be incredibly important. And right now...
MARIANNE LAKE: It's good, right, sentiment in consumer. And we just got back some sentiment from a whole bunch of our middle market companies that while neither are at their high, they're still very high.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So I mean, I think it's an incredibly nuanced question because, in general, Home Lending is -- has a challenging market backdrop. For us, it's A Tale of 2 Cities. We're doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market, and we're holding our sort of pricing discipline in corresponder and losing share there. So there's a challenging market backdrop Card was doing well at, and it's a factor of all things we talked about, our investments in digital, product, rewards, all of the above. So we would like to believe that we'll continue to hold our own there. Auto is extremely competitive. We play in prime, superprime space. And we're seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight, credit unions and captives, and so we're willing to lose share to maintain returns there. You bifurcate C&I, we're growing in line or better than the industry in our expansion markets where we've been making the investments, where we've been adding specialized industry coverage, and we'd like to see that because of the investments we're making. But in mature markets, we're, again, being pretty prudent, I wouldn't call it tightening but being very selective. Commercial Real Estate, particularly construction lending, yes, we are tightening. We are being very cautious about new deals and selective about them. So it isn't the case anymore that we would say we are seeking to grow, although we ever were, loan growth is an outcome of a number of factors, mainly the strategic dialogue with our companies but also the environment we're in and it's extremely nuanced. And in many of our businesses, we're going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: And I think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship-driven. So think about kind of low loan new relationships Commercial Term Lending, Real Estate Banking, mortgage, to a lesser degree, Auto, we are seeing we are losing or ceding share where it makes sense to do it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I wouldn't fully annualize the first quarter, but think about we've added bankers and advisers across our businesses. So you're going to get some annualization impact, particularly first quarter into first quarter. We had added more and more as the year progressed. Similarly, something like Auto lease where we grew our Auto lease business revenues and expenses strongly in 2018, and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter, so front office, Auto lease. Some of the technology investments we've been making, the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them were in our run rate in the fourth quarter. And then outside of that, there's a bit more in Real Estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy and then marketing, foundation completion, those things -- there will be timing. So the first quarter will be higher. I wouldn't annualize it. We are going to see, might see growth year-over-year, much more because of revenue growth than because of investments that grows year-on-year, not the same level as last year. And we'll obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at Investor Day, clearly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I mean, it's fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter. And so through the quarter and at year-end, we were able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives, think reverse repos and short-duration assets. And so for us, it was yield-enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration. And that continues to be the case into the first quarter. It contributed to our NIM expansion in the fourth quarter. We continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter, and it's a market opportunity.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So in the quarter, as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to GSEs of about $5 billion. The impact of that was to have a loss on the sale of the portfolio given that they did originate it at lower rates. So as rates are higher, the fair value of the loans is lower. Against that, if you were to look at the rest of the P&L, you'll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the Treasury Department. So it's geography. It's a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there's funding breakage in NII. Just so that you know, when we -- our mortgage loan with RWA at 15% versus a security at 20% with better liquidity value, we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage-backed securities in Treasury. So we'll earn that back over time, net to the company.
MARIANNE LAKE: No, no. And I think -- I'd hate to say this because I know that you don't want to wait a few weeks, but we'll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at Investor Day. But when we gave our medium-term simulation, we said, ""Listen, we did a 17% return on tangible common equity in 2018, and our medium-term guidance is for 17%."" We've underearned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle, maybe we will overearn against it. But NII and reprice lags are higher, and credit is benign. And at some point, we would expect both of those things to normalize, but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers. So we don't know when it will be. And actually, we don't see anything that things -- I know you said, ""Is it second, third or fourth quarter?"" There's no indication that it's in any of those quarters. But we'll have a more comprehensive discussion at Investor Day about range of plausible outcomes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say that, first of all, we did see, given the conditions in the fourth quarter, a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, particularly in ECM and DCM. In M&A, there was a little bit more balance. For every deal that got pushed or stopped there, there were more that came to take its place. But as a result, as we go into the first quarter, pipelines across-the-board are elevated relative to last year, are pretty strong. And at the end of the day, we talked about it earlier, confidence is still high. Companies are still motivated to drive growth. And so the environment should be constructive for continued M&A. Technology, health care, the biotech innovation, technology innovation momentum in ECM that we've been benefiting from and the IPO pipeline should continue, market-dependent. And notwithstanding December, actually, a sort of lower outlook for Rates in the U.S. should broadly be a tailwind for Fixed Income in the first quarter and the first half. So the second half of the year, I think, is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months. But walking into January, again, if the market remains generally constructive, we should see tailwinds across the businesses.
MARIANNE LAKE: 60 basis points, full year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, $14 billion and a bit.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: Although I think we have to say for obvious reasons that we wouldn't expect any near-term recession if there is one to look anything like it did before. And even if it did, given the credit quality of the portfolios, performance would be not only absolutely better, but we think strong on a relative basis.
MARIANNE LAKE: More prime.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the migration intraproduct from noninterest to interest-bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a Wholesale thing at this point. There's not enough rate benefit in the interest-bearing savings to drive intraproduct migrations. Definitely, some growth outlook in CDs given pricing, but it's Wholesale right now, and it's mainly rate-related and not balance sheet-related in terms of the Fed unwind.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Following that -- it's hard to follow. I will say, look, we've been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around CECL was like properly understanding, not just for us, but for regulators to properly understand the implications for capital, not only in benign but in stressed scenarios, and what the implications of the outcome there could have on the willingness for people to extend credit, particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase. So having a transition is obviously helpful. You should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity. That is what it is. For me, the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impacts of CECL in company-run stress tests, but the Federal Reserve is not going to include it in the stress tests, we need to kind of understand the interplay between those 2 things, particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact. So I think we're looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means. If we're embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are, how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks. And importantly, if it really is the case that we'd have to up-front significant amounts of capital for longer-term or lower-credit quality loans. I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics conceptually don't change that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer-duration assets if there are concerns around potential vulnerability, and we should worry about that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: So our view is that more analysis needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like. I hope that what was meant by we should include it in company-run stress tests is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that. But remember, 2022, considering all the discussion we've had on this call about the cycle, how long the cycle is, when there's a turn in the cycle, and we could actually face a stress before that. And so it's great that they are waiting a bit, but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: And we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics. But someone who have a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So just on your question, so corporate loan spreads, I would say we did see a sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate loan spreads. But over the last actually couple of quarters, we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels. So while I would say it's still true to say that there is a lot of competition, at least in the space in which we're operating, we're seeing spreads at relatively stable levels in the corporate space. And honestly, I don't remember saying that I thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail basis in the short term. I mean, obviously, at some point, when the absolute levels of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid gets to a certain level and if normalization continues, we would expect to see reprice lags sort of catch up. But we have not seen that yet outside of CDs in the retail space right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: So in checking and savings and lead savings, it's nothing. In CDs, it's something, but it rounds to a very small number.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would say that we've been -- we benefited from the fact that year-end and into the early part of January and the holiday season have a light calendar, typically in January for IPOs, in particular. But for sure, if we don't see the ability to get approvals from the SEC on IPOs and, to a lesser extent, some of the M&A deals that need approvals from government agencies, it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized. So I mean, it's one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks very much, everyone.",-0.2200000000000002,0.43599999999999856,1,0.10996693316015274,0.13430064427840618
36,Q1_2010,"
MIKE CAVANAGH, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, operator. Good morning everybody. It's Mike. We're going to do the usual here, so I'm going to refer to a presentation that's available on our website, so please get that in front of you if you don't already have it. And we'll go through that and then take some Q&A at the end. I'll just remind people to look at the slide in the back that makes the comments about forward-looking statements. And so with that let me just get going on page one. And just describe the high level trends and the numbers. So overall, $3.3 billion in net income for the Company, earnings per share of $0.74 on strong revenue number of $28 billion. You see this little table here that shows you what I'll call some large significant items. I'm not going to go through them here because I'll cover all of them when I hit the relevant business where they appear. I'll just say it's in two broad buckets as you can see from here. One, it's the adjustments to levels of loan loss or credit cost, loan loss reserves related to credit across Investment Bank, Retail and Card. That's where you'll hear those. And then a couple of items of significance in our Corporate segment, both investment portfolio gains as well as some litigation reserves we've put up there, so we'll cover that when we get to Corporate. So the themes, though, are a very strong Investment Banking results on strong Fixed Iincome markets revenue and continued strength in the investment banking fee side. Consumer credit trends you're going to hear are all starting to look very good on the delinquency side and we'll cover that further in the businesses. Other businesses performing strongly as a general matter and the balance sheet and capital position, obviously as you'll see continuing to be quite strong. I'm going to skip slide two. You can just look at that. It gives you the sort of GAAP picture, what the numbers look like that I just referred to versus prior periods. So let's start with the businesses and do that with the Investment Bank on page three. Here you see the Investment Bank had net income of $2.5 billion, the circled number there over on the left on revenues of $8.3 billion. That's an ROE of 25% on the $40 billion of allocated capital we have in the Investment Bank that we just increased at the beginning of the year. Going through some of the components, I already made the comment about how our investment banking fee number is a number one share on a year-to-date basis, $1.4 billion of revenues in the quarter on strong bond underwriting versus prior quarters. You'll see a page in the Appendix in the back that gives you a sense for where we are across the various capital raising areas, but continue to feel very good about the Investment Bank corporate finance side of things and the prospects for the rest of the year looking ahead and taking a look at the pipeline. On the Fixed Income and Equity Markets side, I would just say very strong results and it's generally speaking across all desks, and all areas. $5.5 billion of revenues in Fixed Income Markets and $1.5 billion in Equity Markets. And so that gets you really to the overall revenues that we have of, $8.3 billion. So the next item that really drives the Investment Bank P&L is credit costs, so here you see we had a release, an actual benefit, a net benefit in credit costs as reserve take-downs exceeded charge-offs. Charge-offs themselves were offset by reserves because as you know in this business, we downgrade and put up reserves in advance of a charge-off event. So there was for those amounts of actual charge-offs in the quarter there were already reserves covering the P&L, so it's just a line swing there. So the net release really comes from the fact that we had loan sales that were done inside our marks net of reserves and, therefore, had excess reserves after we sold those loans and the same with some loan paydowns that happened as you continue to see the trend in end of period loans, dramatically changing versus prior periods, as large corporates have substantial access to the capital markets. So the next point there, I would just say, allowance for loan losses at $2.6 billion after the change in reserves against loans is about 5%, would be about 7% or so had we not consolidated the conduits as part of the FAS 166/167 stuff. So the issue there, moving on then to NPLs. I just want to point NPL's down from $3.5 billion to $2.7 billion. The last point I'll make in the Investment Bank is just on the expense side, $4.8 billion of expenses in the quarter. Two drivers there, 35% comp to revenue ratio. That is just an outcome of the real underlying detailed analysis we do on risk adjusted returns in the business by area comes out to that number. In a strong quarter with $8.3 billion worth of revenue, you would expect to be at the lower end of the range that we talked about last quarter of 35% to 40%, but that number will bounce around based upon the underlying methodology and obviously it's a first quarter accrual that will get trued-up and will be competitive and do what we need to do over the course of the full year. The other item is some increased litigation reserves including for some mortgage related items in the Investment Bank as well. So that's it for the Investment Bank. Retail Financial Services, moving on to slide four. Here I'm not going to go through all these drivers. You can look at them for yourself. They generally trend consistent with what we've seen before, good growth in the Retail Banking side. But what I do want to point out, we sent out an 8-K last week to just give you the new segmentation after Charlie's Investor Day presentation telling you how we were going to attempt to get a better, cleaner view of what the mortgage banking origination side and auto and student lending, consumer lending businesses would look like without the noise of the real estate portfolios which have obviously been suffering and will continue to. So that's really what we've done in the middle box, is separate out and you'll see it on the next profit and loss page, the same dynamic. At the bottom, real estate portfolios, it's the totality of the home equity lending business, on balance sheet as well as the mortgage balances, whether it's Chase originated, WaMu originated, those are the dynamics rolling through there. What you see in the middle is the mortgage origination side, production revenue, MSR risks management, warehouse and so forth as well as the auto business, primarily is the big one away from mortgage. So moving on to the next page which just tells you what happened on the P&L for the quarter. In Retail Banking you see net income was $131 million loss. Up on the upper left there. And again, it's a tale of two cities. So taking piece by piece, you see about $900 million worth of profits in Retail Banking, up a little bit year-over-year, down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Couple less days on net interest income versus last quarter is the decline there, and then behaviors as well as some of our changes in number of items, bringing down quarter-over-quarter some of the NSF/OD fees in this quarter versus the fourth quarter. Moving on to mortgage banking, the only thing I'll really point out is in the revenue side, when you look at the big comparison versus a year ago, I'll just remind you that we made about $1 billion which was an extraordinary positive on MSR risk management a year ago, was slightly positive this year and that's the big swing factor in revenues year-over-year. We continue to have embedded in those revenue numbers elevated levels of repurchased contra revenues there. Stable with what we had in the past couple of quarters, about $400 million worth or so of repurchased reserve expense. Finally, on the real estate side, you see the bottom line, $1.3 billion loss net of the continued high level of credit costs, but as well, a $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion adjustment to loan loss reserves for the WaMu credit impaired portfolio. Let me drill into credit trends here for Home Lending on page six. So I'll point you now to page 15 in our Appendix, which shows you the delinquency trends across all the major portfolios on the consumer side including these portfolios in Credit Card and what you will see in all of those is improvements in early bucket delinquencies. So we do see that, we'll talk about it more when we get to credit card. So that backdrop is favorable for where we may go from here. But in the quarter itself, you'll see, if you're looking at the left of the page, balances continue to come down versus prior year in these portfolios. We're not originating at these kind of levels, that we talked before. So balances continue to come down. Charge-offs stabilizing a little lower than what it was last quarter and given what I just said about the early bucket delinquency trends improving somewhat, we are hopeful that we may see some improvement in these numbers such that we don't achieve the prior outlook which continues to be printed on the right side of the page. We're not yet ready to lower those numbers, but we'll just say that that's what we had said before. We're seeing some positive trends and hopefully in another couple of months we can report some improvements on actual trajectory of charge-offs on the back of the improved delinquency trends, just not ready to do that yet. When it comes down at the bottom right to just the WaMu credit impaired portfolios, as you know, we have to do life of loan reserving here and so all I would say here is we're not seeing the pace of improvement in the WaMu portfolio, particularly on the prime side, whether it's prime mortgage or prime option ARM that we're seeing in the rest of the Chase portfolios on average due to concentrations in FICO scores, lower FICO scores and geographies. That slower pace of improvement, when you roll it through lifetime loss expectations and some of the other inputs, yields a true-up of the lifetime loss expectations that we have to reserve for, so that's a $1.2 billion reserve addition in aggregate for WaMu credit impaired. So moving on to Credit Card on slide seven. See net income of $300 million loss. The big story is credit. Let me talk about charge-offs first. So you'll see on the Chase, over on the left side, down towards the bottom, you see the 10.54% net charge-off ratio, that's excluding WaMu, which is the way we talk about it. As you know, we had a benefit due to a payment holiday done early last year which is about a 60 basis point negative impact versus the same benefit last quarter. So on a normalized basis, right around a 10%, or plus or minus charge-off ratio. I'll say it now because it comes on the outlook page, that we see that normalized 10%-ish type of charge-off ratio in the next quarter trending more towards 9.5%, plus or minus. And if these delinquency trends that you'll see in the back Appendix continue, hopefully we get improvement further from there in the second half of the year. On the back of all that we've had a lowering of our loan loss allowance by $1 billion in the Credit Card business on the back of everything I just described. In terms of the rest of the P&L, you see revenues affected by the decline in outstandings, which is a large part driven by seasonal effects versus last quarter as well as rundown of WaMu portfolios and sales volumes seasonally down versus last quarter as well, affecting revenues. Otherwise, feel good about the underlying health of the business and the progress we're making there and so that is the main drivers of what's going on in credit card for the loss this quarter. Moving on now to Commercial Banking, slide eight. So the Commercial Bank made about $400 million worth of net revenue. Not really a lot different about the story here than what we've talked about before, so let me cover it briskly here. But I'd say one thing to point out is continued slower pace of but continued reduction in level of loans and leases, $97 billion in the quarter, down from $100 billion last quarter. So while businesses feel to us to be adjusted and poised to grow when they get orders in and have need to do it, they aren't yet at that point. We're seeing that more in small business. I didn't cover that on the retail page, but we did see some pick-up in small business demand and lending there, about $2 billion of originations in the quarter. Here you're yet to see that effect but we're hopeful that that could be coming shortly. On the other side of the revenue effect of the balance sheet to key liability balances, cash deposits that are left with us up from a year ago at $133 billion, and up a little bit from last quarter at $122 billion. So that, together with continued good performance on the fee side in revenue, Treasury Services products and Investment Banking fees which continue to be strong, get you to about flattish revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Credit side improvement from last quarter, with credit costs in total of $214 million. Largely, 75% of the credit costs coming from real estate related portfolios, which as you know were underweighted on a relative basis. And so nonetheless, we end the quarter with north of 3% allowance to loan loss reserves against 96 basis point charge-off rate in the quarter. Treasury and Security Services on slide nine, again, We'll start with net income, $279 million, up a little bit from last quarter, but just covering the revenue side. So you see in Worldwide Security Services, the securities side, we're still seeing the negative impact of declining deposit balances, as well as continued narrow and somewhat narrowing spreads on securities lending in the quarter and FX revenues we get off of that business not fully offset by the benefit of higher assets under custody at $15.3 trillion in the quarter. So the same dynamics continue to grind sideways on revenues in that business. And then the Treasury and Security Services side, $882 million of revenues, you see the average liability balances beginning to stabilize, $250 billion last quarter and $248 billion this quarter, down from a year ago on the back of flight to quality moving against us after the peaks we saw in late 2008, early 2009. That flowing through on tighter deposit spreads for the revenue effect there and that's really what explains the P&L in Treasury and Security Services. Last business, Asset Management on page 10. About $400 million in net income, up a lot year-over-year, down a touch from last quarter, $2.1 billion worth of revenues on $1.2 trillion in assets under management. I'd say just remember that versus a year ago, revenues up, given the effect of higher assets under management there, on higher market levels. And versus last quarter, the decline is really just driven by the absence of performance fees which are billed largely as a seasonal event in the fourth quarter. So health of the business looks good here. We have seen some decline in flows as client activity is putting money back to work out of liquidity products primarily, but away from that we've actually seen growth in assets under management and flows in products away from liquidity products, which we think is a good sign of health of the business. Lastly, Corporate in P&L impact terms. You see total Corporate, we had a little bit of private equity gains, revenues of $136 million which translates into $55 million worth of net income. And then in Corporate, which is everything else, we have $173 million of profits. So I'll just hit on the three items that you see described on the right in the bullets. So again, we had another quarter where we had strong gains. We don't usually count on gains or guide for gains, but we had gains of $1 billion related to repositioning the Corporate investment portfolio and some trading activity that happens there. So that's $1 billion positive just to call out and understand that's a significant item to the positive. We may still have another quarter, we can always have quarters that have some effect on that line. We may have that again in the second quarter, maybe not to this magnitude, as we continue to focus on how we want the investment portfolio positioned. The second point is that we continue to benefit, though, running a large investment portfolio. The net interest income coming off the investment portfolio continues to run at a higher level than what I would call normalized. And those two effects are the reason why on the outlook slide this number for Corporate I have us guiding you lower on that as we get towards the end of the year to a number more like $300 million plus or minus. One other noisy item in the quarter, not going to get into a lot of details on it -- you see we added $2.3 billion to litigation reserves in Corporate for the firm, largely related to mortgage related matters. Think about that as we have repurchased reserves that we've talked about related to the GSEs as an ongoing expense that we've been reserving for. This relates to the broader question of all other ideas for claims against us from private investors and others related to whether it's a good portion WaMu related. We just put a lot of energy. We're not unique in having exposures here. We've talked about these potential exposures before. We just put a lot of energy into coming up with an estimate to put a marker down in our results and so that's all on that item. Capital on slide 12. You see we had 11.5% Tier 1 capital ratio and 9.1% Tier 1 common. Just remind people, you see the bullet below that table, that we did adopt FAS 166/167, bringing variable interest entities on balance sheet. The real effect is $88 billion worth of GAAP assets, very little risk weighted assets or de minimus risk weighted assets as we largely had that covered in our risk weightings before. The one real material effect was the fact that through our actual GAAP equity we had to put up loan loss reserves for the credit card receivables that came on balance sheet. So that was about $7 billion of reserves pretax, about $4.5 billion decline that just went to the equity account, negatively impacting capital, but nonetheless you see the ratios are very strong and we end the quarter with $39 billion worth of total credit reserves ratio of nearly 6%. So finally, on the Outlook slide, I think I really covered this. Let me just pick through everything that you see on the retail side is as it was before. As I said, we're not necessarily reaffirming this guidance. Hopefully, it could be better. But we're not ready to change these numbers. We do see delinquency trends looking positive, but we have to wait for that to really pull through and more to come in future quarters. Card Services side, I've covered all this. Again, no real changes from what we've said before, but for the lowering of the charge-off estimate on the Chase portfolio to down from what we experienced this quarter by about 50 basis points, looking into the second quarter, with the likelihood of some improvement from there in the second half of the year. Corporate I already talked about the $300 million plus or minus number that you could expect to see as we get towards the back end of the year. I'll just remind people that to the extent that there is a bonus tax imposed in the UK, we expect that to be a second quarter accounting event. And so with that, that is the quarter and that is our outlook. I'll just remind you we've got a couple of slides here after this that I won't go through that just cover a few of the items I referred to earlier. So with that we can just open it up to questions operator.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Glenn, this is Jamie, just real quickly. Let's all not call it a bank fee and call it what it is which is a punitive bank tax.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, I think you heard me cover some of the items, Glenn. You hit on some of the businesses are market sensitive, but clearly you look at the market sensitive results and you've got to feel good about the franchise we've got here. So if the market opportunities present themselves and we're serving our clients and those businesses can do well. We think secular trends there over the long term are good. Obviously it's too early to call what kind of regulatory impacts there could be in any of these businesses and how business models react. But we're not worried about our ability to compete and do well in the market side businesses. On the lending side businesses, you clearly have the dynamics of portfolios running off, affecting revenues. Away from that, though, again I think you see it in noise in some of the numbers quarter-over-quarter, but I think we're positioned to keep building the businesses, taking market share and growing. So we're investing. The story I would say is, as you heard in Investor Day, investing for growth in all these businesses. More bankers, more branches, better products, California and the Commercial Bank. So that's what I would point you to. But secular, I guess overlying trends of asset rundown and potential for regulatory impacts, yes, we'll have to deal with those. But we understand that and we'll do fine.
MIKE CAVANAGH: In the first half of the year you'll have a lot of the impacts on card side will be in the run rate. We're still waiting for a few pieces of Card Act legislation to really be finalized which won't happen until June, reasonable and proportionate fees. But away from that we are going to have it in our run rates shortly. Retail, we have a partial impact of some of the actions we took on overdraft fees, reducing number of items in this quarter is already in the run rate. There's some changes in customer behaviors anyway, lowering overdraft fees in the quarter. And so the rest of those effects won't come in until the latter part of the year when all the changes go in, third quarter, I guess. So by the end of the year you would probably see those kind of effects.
JAMIE DIMON: This is Jamie. Number one is VAR is just a measure which is an adequate measure of most things. Remember, you're dropping very volatile trading months from a year ago and adding very benign trading months now to VAR. That's a huge reason why VAR has dropped so much. It's not just volatility. First of all, people did a great job. Spreads are back to kind of where they were. Think of it as they've almost normalized and that's fine. But a lot of client flow, a lot of volume and good trading around there.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, that number is going to bounce around a little bit. Putback numbers were about similar to what they were over the last couple of quarters. No insight into vintage burnout or anything like that yet
MIKE CAVANAGH: Nothing different than what Charlie covered at Investor Day is what I would say.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I'd say it's better than just a guess. We did work on it when we did it, but it was an early estimate so let's leave it at that. We need to see how everything evolves from here. But it was a reasonable estimate when we did it. We need to see how it actually pulls through.
JAMIE DIMON: So far we think the more consumer-friendly thing is to fairly offer the consumer option. Not to push it in marketing but to very fairly say you have this option or that option. That still is our intent. And BofA remember will offer that at the ATM for cash. They'll notify the customer. So we want to treat the customer very fairly. We think offering them options probably is something they prefer. Remember, they can always turn it down.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: That's a very static analysis and we'll look at it again and we'll re-up it. We don't think it's going to change dramatically over time.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Two things. One, it depends on when you did your initial marks and where rate levels were, so there's one effect of actual market driven assumptions at the time you did things. And two is, we may have that dynamic over time. Remember, we do the SOP 03-3 evaluation at subportfolios, so we've been focused on our prime option ARM and prime mortgage portfolios. Other ones have been behaving okay. If the day comes when we have a view that they'll come in below lifetime loss expectations, we may have an adjustment to make. But that would be down the road.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Correct. Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hi.
JAMIE DIMON: If you look at HAMP, which is a government program, and I'm looking in total, not for JPMorgan. The government was aiming for 3 to 4 million mods. We actually think at current ramp rates, take a long time to ramp it up, we will get to about 2 million on HAMP. That's what we believe, okay. In addition to that, most of the banks do other modifications which those are good for customers, so for us it's more than double of what we're doing in terms of HAMP mods. On the mortgage lending categories, all of the indicators, new delinquencies, roll-rates, step severities there, they're all getting a little bit better and we think that's good. And that trend stabilized late last year, January, February, March, we've gotten better. So it's early. Those are actual numbers. You're guessing about what future changes might be because of legislation or stuff like that and we don't know. We're hoping they'll get better. We also think a lot of that will be driven by the economy, not by anything else.
JAMIE DIMON: Based on the way we see it now, Guy.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. So let me make this simple, okay? In the Investment Bank, Retail and Corporate, we have put up rep and warranty reserves and litigation reserves for GSEs and all other mortgages including private securities. We tried to do it diligently. Some of those numbers ran through the Investment Bank this quarter. We've broken out the numbers in Retail and we put the numbers in Corporate. A lot of the numbers in Corporate relate to WaMu. We are not going to give any other information. We think we have properly accrued for reps and warranties whether they come through on the rep and warranty line or the litigation line. There are legitimate claims that some of these mortgages were properly done. It's going to be done mortgage by mortgage. Other than that I think we've done a pretty good job of recognizing the problem early.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's hard to answer the question. There is plenty of client volume and I don't know the turnover rates offhand. You might see the balance sheet go up a little bit over time from here.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, again, Betsy, your assumptions about what the future holds is as good as ours. Credit card, what we look at today, remember, we have real visibility only really into next quarter. Those reserves could be coming down over time. Mortgage, the numbers are starting to look hopeful, so there's so much uncertainty around mortgage that I want to see it myself before you actually start taking it down. The real question for mortgage to me is how long the high losses last. That's the real question for me in mortgage, not just the reserve number, because huge loss is running through our books today and I think in Commercial, I put all the wholesale in this, Investment Banking and middle market, it looks like underlying credit trends are getting better, including the reduction in non-performers, repair of non-performers, and the financial stability of companies.
JAMIE DIMON: We're working on that now and we're not ideologically opposed to principal forgiveness. The issue with that it's got to be done loan by loan to be fair. There's no other way to do it that's proper and fair, both to the mortgage and to the bank and I don't want to double count it because remember, if you do principal forgiveness, it's not that different than reducing payments for five years. So you can double count a little bit, but if we change our programs and we add some additional principal forgiveness programs, it might change some of those loss rates going forward, but we don't know that for sure but it might. Remember, we already have a lot of reserves for this stuff. High losses are going through. Underlying trends are getting a little better.
JAMIE DIMON: It's also not completely clear what all the government programs, so we're still working to kind of clarify what it is they meant on some of those programs.
JAMIE DIMON: 53%.
JAMIE DIMON: Look. Honestly, if things start to peak out and the economy gets better you're through the worst part, but there's a ways to go. As you all see, as I see what's going on in Washington and things like that, but the underlying trends look good. We shouldn't forget that.
JAMIE DIMON: So I think we've been very clear on the dividend. We want to see real underlying employment growth for at least several months. That's number one. Number two, we would like to see real and sustained improvements in delinquencies and charge-offs in mortgages, and that's not just one month. We would like to see it continue for a while. Number three, I think we've pointed out as have other banks, there's a lot of capital uncertainty. Uncertainty around Basel II rules, Basel III rules, dividend tax rules, bonus tax rules and we would like to see some of that clear up before we start using our capital. So that number will probably continue to go up over time. We want to make sure that we are always, always properly capitalized and this Company is never questioned and if you end up with excess you capital you haven't thrown it away, you just get to use it later.
JAMIE DIMON: It's possible, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm talking about net job creation. That is the really important thing, getting more people back to work. The other number has a lot of other calculations in it.
JAMIE DIMON: No. I think what I mean by real job creation is that we really believe we've got a sustained recovery. That to me is a couple hundred thousand jobs being added for several months in a row.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The other one is our own credit costs. It's not just delinquencies, it's credit costs making the turn. In retail they've stabilized. We would like to see them turn downward.
JAMIE DIMON: There are no credit card modification programs any different today than there were way back. And remember, by the end of -- the last two years, we've written off close to 20% of the portfolio. You would expect in an economic recovery, or even a stability, that delinquencies and charge-offs would come down and in fact they are. We've written off a lot of the bad stuff
JAMIE DIMON: I think you're talking about the things that are in credit workout and stuff. That just tracks charge-offs and bankruptcies and stuff like that.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That is working through the bad stuff, the challenged stuff. So as you see that charge-offs are associated with that which is the charge-offs Jamie's talking about and you're left with a better performing portfolio at the end of that process.
JAMIE DIMON: In credit card, across income spans, FICO bands and vintages, we are seeing improvements in delinquencies and charge-offs.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the main driver is the fact that the people who were worst off have already charged off. And in prior recessions, when unemployment stops going up, you start to see an improvement in those things. So that is typical in a recession, that the rate of change of unemployment is a bigger driver of credit card delinquencies and losses than simply absolute rates of unemployment.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You mean in terms of -- When do you start to see it stabilize in terms of size?
JAMIE DIMON: I think the Chase portfolio, I would say which is $132 billion of it, is already -- we believe it's basically stabilized as it is, and the WaMu portfolio, which is how much?
MIKE CAVANAGH: $20 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: $20 billion.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Going to keep going down.
JAMIE DIMON: It's going to keep going down, and I think we gave some of that number at Investor Day.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I think you see us rolling out in credit card new programs all the time and I think auto loans are up and I think jumbo loans are up just a little bit, but they're up, maybe double from a year ago. And we still have, and we broke this out at Investor Day, a large liquidation in the Home Lending portfolio because people are no longer doing subprime, Alt-A and a bunch of products and option ARM and some of that we acquired from WaMu. That is going to run off. But the other stuff, year-over-year, I think you actually may start to see increases.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. I think you've seen a lot of real estate stuff get restructured when it has problems. It's kind of a delayed lag that's going to happen over the next two years, but if there's a proper way to do real estate lending secured with the right developers and if we get some of the upside, we'd be happy to do it.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the way to look at us today is today we were at a fairly neutral position and so I think the disclosure we make in the 10-K shows for interest rate, the whole curve going up 100 basis points, $300 million. But that's -- call that a very, very neutral position. So we've already gone from being short funded to neutral and the question is are we going to change it from there. We don't have to change it at all, but my guess is we will change it and rising long rates help earnings. Rising short rates hurt earnings. And so when you talk about neutralizing it, you're going to neutralize one versus the other, a little complex, but we like where we are today and over time that portfolio will probably come down. That portfolio is just one measure of interest rate exposure.
JAMIE DIMON: And hasn't come down that much, that portfolio. We have changed the components of it.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say we are reducing some of the extension risk and reducing some of the credit exposure in it.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: I would say it's very little proprietary. When you talk about pure proprietary. It is a lot of client flow. We're not only ones who saw that. I think you're going to see other people report similarly good numbers, somewhat driven by client flow and it's good results by our traders. They're on the ball. They're paying attention. And rising rates don't necessarily hurt your trading results. It's not because we're taking a mismatch in trading to see some of that. There is some benefit from the fact that spreads keep on coming in and you have the reverse from last year, instead of losses from mortgage, legacy credit and mortgage positions, you have small gains in those things. But -- and we agree, we think it was a very good quarter for FICC in particular and we're not going to tell you we expect it to continue like that all year.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Mike, I wouldn't say we ever -- we always talked about trading as volatile and hard to predict. Obviously, we've got an investment in people and balance sheet and infrastructure, so you would expect -- you expect results that are positive. This was a strong quarter. No question about it. And so likely on average runs lower than this level, but I'm not going to give you a number on where.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it's very hard to have a positive impact. And the devil's in the details here. When we oversimplify, we're not doing justice to the issue. We do believe that most standardized things will go to a clearing house and that's fine. That in of itself doesn't have a huge impact on revenues. Then there's the issue about how much of those and other trades go through an exchange in the transparency. That could or couldn't depending on how it's designed and how much room is left to do -- have exceptions over the counter or end user exceptions and that's not defined yet. So it will be a negative, Mike, and depending on the real detail, it could be several hundred million to a couple billion dollars.
JAMIE DIMON: Our traders did a good job. That was also cash derivatives and prime broker. So I put it all together. I think they all had a good quarter.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Across the Investment Bank, Americas did great, Asia did pretty well, Europe did pretty well, but not as well as it had done before, if I'm recalling the numbers correctly.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No particular areas of weakness. It was strong pretty much everywhere.
JAMIE DIMON: Listen, first of all, I think in Credit Card it's going to be virtually gone because the big credit card companies -- most of them don't need to do it at all. So some issuers will do it. And there's a lot of detail on that 5%, so we're not opposed to the concept of skin in the game. The detail is what tranches, how you do it. I think it will make it smaller, but it won't eliminate it. That's my own guess. And the real securitization markets that you haven't seen come back yet are the mortgage securitization markets, and I think at one point you're going to see that. 5% will just change what kind of returns you need, what the spreads will be on the total securitization to give the person who's going to own the 5% an equity like return on what they have to retain since it's permanent.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We'll get our comments in. We talked a little bit about this at Investor Day. There's going to be a lot of things out there that the big issue is how all those ideas that are on the table and rightly so, how in the proposal they connect together with each other, the capital side of Basel III, the liquidity side of Basel III, together with everything that's in play today away from Basel III. The biggest point is to just make it cohesive and thoughtful and take time to evaluate the impact analyses that are going to be under way as well. I won't give you a particular -- it's powerful potential changes in there that has been well commented on, but our feedback is in and we hope to see a process whereby we get a revised set of proposals towards the end of the year, after impact studies are done but we may not get that, we may just get a final rule. We'll see.
JAMIE DIMON: I think most people think some of the things in Basel -- no one's against proper capital and liquidity. That we need. A lot of those things in Basel III had too much. You can't include agency and MBS as liquid securities. 30% of deposits have to be held. There is going to be a run on 30% of deposits. You need to all own T-bills against that. I think a lot of that's going to get modified appropriately. So the impact of Basel III will be when it's ultimately rolled out will be substantially less than the impact that you saw on the initial Basel III proposal. The other thing that's really important for American banks is it needs to be consistent globally. That is an important competitive attribute. I think the regulators know that. If you have different countries do it, it would have a dramatic effect. I also want to point out that Basel III will have a much bigger effect on non-US banks. So the European banks, they have to look at those numbers and they will have a different reaction to it and probably going to want to phase that in over two years to 50 to make up for the dramatic impact in the balance sheet.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's really the back end stuff, Jason. It just continues, the back ends have elevated levels of delinquency rates. I think 10%-15% is what we said once upon a time, but haven't freshened that up. Remember, it's not an income statement effect, the fact that those are getting delayed, because we're being very active in making sure that we charge things down and realize economic loss just because of those very delays. Yet it does create some inflation of back end delinquency rates, which is why we're so focused on those charts, early bucket delinquencies, mid-bucket delinquencies and then what's going on in the 150 day plus where some of that stuff sits for longer before it gets cycled out is a separate issue that has some distortions in it.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't get the question.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think it's really a function of just we're trying to give a sense that those rundowns are real when you consider how much of even the Chase portfolio, when you apply current underwriting standards, given proven income as opposed to stated income, LTVs that are sensitive to forward home price expectations and lower, all those layered in against a reasonable set of origination levels that would qualify there, given where home prices are, is what's driving that. If those underlying factors allow us to do more volume at those kind of new lending standards, the numbers could be different. But that's a reasonable guess on where we might find ourselves going over many years.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I'd say -- look back on where we were running, low 30s. We were a little bit lower than that, high 20s this quarter, on a reported basis. So a little bit of audit settlements in this quarter deflated the ratio, but for that we would have been around in the low 30s which is a decent place to see the number.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think it's more of the fact that it's a little hard right now given the inflection we're seeing to tune up a better number to give you, than to say that's what we last said, hold the thought while we get some more months of experience under us. But given what we're seeing in early buckets, it could be that we don't hit those numbers. That's the best I can give you on that score, just not yet able and ready to give numbers as good as what we had before. But we're just caveating that they're not so solid anymore, given some of the early trends.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, the actual rollrates, delinquencies, charge-offs, by vintage, look a little better. But add to that the uncertainty around housing, government programs, new foreclosures, the economy, we're being cautious.
JAMIE DIMON: Nancy, this is -- it's hard to say because you're talking about something that really relates almost more to competition than anything else. I believe that if you have a rising rate environment, short rates going up 100, 200 basis points, long rates going up 100, 200 basis points, but it's because of a healthy economy, everything will be fine. If you have stag-inflation, rates going up, you don't have a healthy economy, that's probably the worst situation for a bank. And in and of itself, it's not the interest rate exposure, it's the other things that are going to drive that, including as you pointed out, competition.
JAMIE DIMON: When we talk about interest rate exposures, we already built into that our assumptions about how much a rate rises you pass on to consumers. So we already assumed that and I'd say we're pretty aggressive assuming that you have to pass on quite a bit of it, at least early on in an interest rate cycle. And on the consumer side, you look at consumers, they have a lot of excess cash. If you talk to our economists. A lot of that's also in money market funds. It's a little bit different in deposit accounts. And -- but we're going to compete for our clients business like everybody else and we're assuming that it will be competitive going forward.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I'd say it was about stable. No material action in that, nor looking ahead would I expect there would necessarily be when you put aside the deliberate stuff we're doing in the investment portfolio or just the outcome of what's going on in the trading businesses.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Well, since it's going to take years to sort all this stuff out, we took an estimate now and I think it would be a while before we had any reason to make any changes to that.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't expect to have to make any, but you never know when it comes to these items.
JAMIE DIMON: It looks fine. We point out many times before, pipelines are notoriously bad. Things go away and things come in and the debt market, sometimes the pipeline is not there at there because deals get done very quickly, but it looks healthy.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The only point I want to make is remember, it may be material and if it does happen it's likely to be a second quarter accounting event. That's the only point I really want to make at this stage.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's a one off, if it happens, even if it is material.
JAMIE DIMON: So the government in the UK says.
JAMIE DIMON: I should have said this before. Across vintages, FICO scores, LTVs, regions, states, we're seeing pretty much improvement. It's very broad-based.
JAMIE DIMON: I would put it in the not much category.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think that's right. My bet would be it's going to take some time for that to actually manifest itself. But we'll see.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We may be seeing -- Jamie hit it earlier. What's going on in the Investment Bank is access is there, FAS 167 drove the change in that business net of market activities. I'd say the real litmus test for wholesale would be more your middle market business. There's it's starting to stabilize, but still down a touch from last quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I will put that in the -- first of all, we're already doing that a little bit. We're already modifying seconds and not all seconds have firsts and not all seconds are in trouble, so you've really got to parse through all that, but I will put that as an issue of uncertainty out there that remains, yes. We're also doing the 2MP program like most other banks.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The devil's in the details of how they're done. Not really. Presumably they'll be done in a thoughtful way, which as Jamie said, we're already doing a lot of this stuff on a loan by loan basis in a way that's appropriate and making changes in adjustments and in answer to Guy's questions earlier, we factor all that in to how we think about future charge off's and therefore reserving. We have a view. It's just a question of whether the programs come in with something that's blanket or a less thoughtful approach than we think makes sense.
JAMIE DIMON: That statement, if that were true in some cases, that would be true -- your assumptions are all true, your conclusion would be true. That's not always the case. There's a lot of different reasons why people are doing things.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, you've got to ask the regulators. We had nothing to do with the decisions that were made around declaring them insolvent and stuff like that. Obviously they were having a deposit outflow. As you remember, when we bought the Company, we put up $40 billion for reserves.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We marked down $30 billion, we raised $11.5 billion the next day to replenish the capital that
MIKE CAVANAGH: I'm not aware if there was any bidder other than ourselves.
JAMIE DIMON: I was flying back from China. I didn't see the testimony.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's definitely the latter, growing off lower year-over-year comps. As you go back to some of Gordon's Investor Day slides, the more affluent the segment, the earlier and the greater magnitude of sales pick-up. And we think as it relates to the market broadly, our share of sales is picking up related to all the work that the business is doing with the new products and rewards programs and partners programs we have and then there's some seasonality obviously when you go from the first versus the fourth, a big spending season in the fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: What I saw is that consumer spend and incomes are kind of back to where they were before all this crisis and you've seen retail sales up, you've seen restaurant sales up, you've seen airplane sales up, you've seen car sales up. That's the fact. And you could guess as well as we can guess whether it's going to continue or not.
JAMIE DIMON: I always question that discretionary breakout. We really dig into it, it's hard to determine some of that. Pick out specific luxury items and then travel, vacation type travel, those are up. And they are up even stronger than the aggregates if I remember correctly.
MIKE CAVANAGH: 100% of everything that we know of. There's a straggling piece or two that the final outcomes of what the legislation would be is not yet there.
JAMIE DIMON: Which will probably cost us another $300 million, $400 million, or $500 million. We don't know the real number yet. Just assume it's going to cost something.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm throwing out a number, but yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Purely a guess on my boss's part.
JAMIE DIMON: Say it again.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes, more or less.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, we always said this, that's static analysis. That's saying if you just kind of run it through. People are changing how they price for cards, how they're using cards. That much of the static analysis will be what it ultimately costs the Company three years from now.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's right.
JAMIE DIMON: It's another good sign. Small business loans are up pretty substantially.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Really the change was bringing on $88 billion worth of assets which was largely Credit Card and then you had major change, the equity account was putting up loan loss reserves related to those Card assets.
JAMIE DIMON: But if you look at the quarter, you've got earnings minus the after tax effect of that $7 billion of reserves, plus OCI, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.
MIKE CAVANAGH: A lot of changes in the quarter. The FAS 166/167 was about $4.5 billion after tax negative to the equity account. All driven by the credit card side which was reserves.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's what the accounting pronouncements were on how to handle 166/167. That's a guidance on how all banks will handle that one.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Everything you saw in the Card segment about charge-off rate and the guidance we talked about, none of that is affected by 166/167.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Okay. Well thanks, everybody. Look forward to next quarter. Bye.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",0.11,-0.7599999999999988,0,0.08662827318599135,0.11713004462325129
37,Q2_2012,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: Sarah, thank you very much. I appreciate you all coming today. We have a whole bunch of presentations to take you through. I'll start with me. I'll try to cover some of the high points. Unfortunately, I think you might have see this morning, that we announced a restatement of the first quarter. Doug will describe it in detail, and Mike. We don't take it lightly. We talked to our best advisors, accounting and legal and tried to do what we thought was right, and the most conservative thing to do. Hopefully, this what is the SEC chairwoman herself would have done, if she had seen all the same facts at the same time. Today I'm going to cover, I'll just give you a quick overview. I'm going to talk about a whole bunch of significant events, items in the quarter, which we will break out for you right in the front of the press release, give you an update on the synthetic credit portfolio, talk a little bit about Treasury and CIO, there's some questions about it, so I'm going to try to answer some of those. Our capital plans. I'm going to turn it over to Doug, who is going to take you through the regular earnings presentation, though it's gotten slight more disclosures, and then Mike will give you an update on the CIO task force, kind of the anatomy of the problem, all the good, the bad, the ugly of it. The review is continuing, I should point out. It's being guided by the Board. If we find out more, it's always possible, or anything different or material, we'll let you know as appropriate. If we do find out more, we will do the right thing as we always try to do. One thing, which I would love people to focus on a little bit at one point, actually look at the businesses, the six businesses, they have really good underlying performance. That, to me, is why we're here, the main reason why we're here. We've significantly reduced the total synthetic credit risk in CIO. It's down substantially. I'm going to give you some real numbers and describe how we're going to manage that going forward, including the risks that are going there. We've substantially taken all of the remaining synthetic credit positions, translated them to the IB. We put them there because IB has the people, the expertise, the capacity, the trading platform, the market franchise to effectively trade and manage these positions, and importantly, they can do it within their historical VaR and stress risk limits levels. This is what they do, it's going to let the rest of the firm go back to do what it should be doing. We have closed down synthetic credit trading in CIO. We'll no longer be doing it. I'll tell you one exception of one short position we're keeping there. Our Fortress balance sheet remains completely intact. In fact, I would call it undented. An extensive review has been conducted. Mike will take you through that. Very importantly, all of CIO management has changed. Matt Zames is here. While you may know him professionally, but he also brought in a lot of additional risk people, traders, finance officers to help manage the CIO area. And they've been through top to bottom, all the governance, reporting, limits, et cetera in CIO. We do believe these events are isolated to CIO, and Mike will talk about it a little bit more. These type of events are terrible, but there is one gratifying thing in them. As you find out that people come and bring their best every day, we've had hundreds of people kind of working around the clock now for three months to get this thing fixed, and wrestled down, and I think we've mostly accomplished that. And now we can focus on our energy on what we do best, which is growing our businesses and serving our clients and communities around the world. Hopefully after this is over, we will be a stronger Company for it. We did report net income of $5 billion for the second quarter, that would have been $4.6 billion had it not been the restatement. Earnings of $1.21. The first half, we'll earn $9.9 billion, that is not obviously unaffected by the restatements and the balance sheet and capital ratios are not affected either. In the second quarter, let me take you through each one of these items a little bit slowly. CIO trading losses, that's the synthetic credit book, $4.4 billion. But in the first quarter, it was about $1.6 billion. Not hiding that. We're not doing it, that's $1.6 billion in the first quarter which we moved $600 million by the restatement, $4.4 billion this quarter. Corporate CIO securities gains, we announced that actually when we told you the first time about this problem. We did not take additional securities gains. All I want to point out here, is these are always broken out in the P&L. You can never hide them. We take them generally for investment decisions, do you want to own or not own that security. We don't generally take them to offset something like that, and I pointed out before, that taking gains is generally tax inefficient. Doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, it's just generally tax inefficient. Loan loss reserves came down by $2.1 billion. That's mostly in mortgage and credit card. That's exactly the same conservative principles we used before. The good news is, charge-offs and delinquencies are coming down. Reserves had to come down, and Doug's going to give you a little bit more information on that. Investment bank had $750 million of DVA gains. We all know we don't consider that earnings. On corporate, we expect a full recovery in the Bear Stearns note. Some of you may remember when Maiden Lane was done, when the Fed took on $30 billion of Bear Stearns' assets we guaranteed the $30 billion of loss. Maiden Lane, they completely repaid the Federal Reserve. We've now been paid $200 million. I think we get another $300 million sometime in a couple weeks. We expect full recovery of the $1.2 billion plus interest, that's just writing the note back up to what we expect to get in cash, plus interest over a little bit of time. I won't go through the capital ratios here. I'm going to talk about them a little bit later. Moving to the synthetic credit portfolio, the only other thing I would mention too, of the losses in synthetic credit, it is kind of costly. The worst part of this whole thing, is when we started this thing, we knew we had these large illiquid type of things to manage down, and we had $2 billion plus at that time. We have been reducing the risk substantially, go through these numbers, but it's costly to do. It's costly to do. I'm going to give you the final ultimate risk. We did get it down a little bit faster than we thought we might be able to do. Number one, we're transferring about -- I'm going to give you rough, crude measures of risk here. They generally are accurate, but this is in the trading book, so we're not going to disclose specific positions. The risk weighted asset transfer to the IB, and this is a fairly decent measure of risk is about $30 billion. So their risk weighted asset is up by $30 billion. It's down substantially from the peak, and it's about probably where it was on December 30, so it went way up, it's come way down. We've significantly reduced net notionals and credit spread sensitivities. We show you, the credit spread sensitivity, CS01 is how much you would gain or lose if credit spreads widened by 1 basis point. You can see it's down from a peak of $51 billion to $7 billion. $7 billion is close to what I call a norm. We have a significant reduction in the on-the-run and the off-the-run basis, this is part of what we read about all the time about the IG9. The IG9 itself is down around 70%. We reduced the basis risk between high yield and high grade risk in Europe and the United States. These are the kind of risks that got built up, complex risk which we wish we didn't have when we realized it was there. They're down by 70%, and what remains is not, in my opinion, that big a deal. The residual portfolio that's transferred over to the IB is largely a delta-hedged tranche portfolio. It's stuff they know how to do. They're better at it than [SEFO] is. It's still large. We're not saying it's not large. It still could obviously could lose money or perhaps make money. Some of the positions are currently cheap to theoretical. That's how they were when we inherited them, when Matt Zames joined us, and I'm giving you within number here. Extreme simulated scenarios indicate a potential loss between $800 million and $1.7 billion. This portfolio could make money. The extreme simulated losses are things like a Euro zone crisis, a credit crunch and the 99.9% stress, statistical stress that have a loss about $1.4 billion. We do things as a box. I hope we don't have these losses at all. To help us a little bit in the quarter, we will have about a $900 million gain on swaps we have terminated against some of our TRuPS, but we think we're pretty much done with the financial loss of this, and we can look at that gain. I've already mentioned that we transferred to the IB and why. And there are already -- we're more actively trading it than we were. If you look at the combined IB and synthetic credit portfolio risk within the IB historical, RWA as I mentioned, went up by $30 billion, not that significant to them. Their VaR, I think it will be disclosed that the IB VaR at the end of the month was -- the spot VaR was $74 million. The next day when we transferred over, July 2, it went to $113 million. Well within the numbers we were used to, and comfortable. We've had as high as $200 million. The remaining portfolio that we left at CIO is simple. It's an $11 billion short, basically liquidity indexes, it's identified to offset some potential losses in a much larger AFS portfolio, asymmetric, one is marked-to-market, one is not, so we're not worried about this. We getting one to far offset the loss of the other, and vice versa, but we need to make separate decisions, do you want to own those investments or not own those investments. We thought now was a rational time to keep a hedge on certain credit exposures around the world, particularly what you see going now with the Euro zone. This hedge will come down over time. We don't intend to keep it there necessarily forever. Obviously we'll make those decisions as we see fit. It will show a VaR, remember, it's $11 billion, it will have its own VaR, it's not hedged against anything. It's asymmetric, it'll have a VaR of like $135 million coming down over time. On it's own, it's about $34 billion of risk weighted assets. The next page, I'm talking about some Treasury and CIO activities, kind of go through this. I suppose I should point out, Treasury and CIO had been and always will be subordinated to the needs of the rest of the Company. They can only invest when, where, how, why, for the needs of the Company. That involves how the duration they invest in, involves the credit they invest in, involves what they invest in around the world. It's not the same portfolio. It's a logical portfolio. Why do we have it at all? We have $1.1 trillion in deposits. We've got $700 billion in loans. That would generally be considered fairly conservative. We like making loans by the way. Between our acquisitions and the fact we're a money centered bank, we get a lot of deposits in, we end up with a lot of extra deposits. The extra deposits are $423 billion, plus equity, plus some of the net liabilities, give us $522 billion, that's not being lent out, that we have to invest. We actually split it in two pieces. Some companies do it differently. Some combine Treasury and CIO, most have functions like this. The first piece is $199 billion, which we call Treasury deployment. We're going to make a disclosure. It's on the balance sheet. It shows up as cash due at banks and sometimes government repo. Most of that money is very short duration, most of it is in central banks around the world. Some of it is in government repo. We have it there just because of liquidity, because we have a lot of money that comes in and out of this Company every single day. We bank member nations, sovereign wealth funds, large companies, can easily swing, $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion a day. Treasury, CIO has $323 billion, it's down a little bit because we haven't been reinvesting the last -- we're waiting to give Matt a little bit of time to figure out what he's got before he starts reinvesting, but it has an average rating of AA and an average life of 3.7 years. I'm going to show you a little more detail on the next page. Post-transfer pricing. We take all the assets, all the liabilities generated by the Company, so take loans and deposits, they're constantly dynamically evaluated for their risk pricing, their duration and liquidity. And we generally then pay units, market prices on what they did. To pay market prices, they have the right kind of incentive to grow or not grow their balance sheet. They do not get gains, securities gains for excess returns and CIO. They get kind of market rates at steady income. If you go back in the years, you saw we had a lot of income in CIO. Back then, we told you that was going to get very high rates, we didn't pass on to the businesses because it wasn't going to continue. So CIO invests to achieve a desired asset liability duration. We obviously change this all the time. All the companies worry about this. I should point out our two biggest exposures are credit and interest rates, and this is the place we kind of manage the most part the interest rate exposure. Currently, if you ask to be duration neutral, to the best of our ability to offset all interest rate exposure, we would have to invest this portfolio in an average interest duration of 3.7 years. It is invested currently at an interest duration of 1.2 years. What that means is that our balance sheet will reprice quicker, the assets will reprice quicker than the liabilities. And that is disclosed in a statement called earnings risk, that says if interest rates go up 100 basis points, earnings would go up by $2.4 billion. That's how you generate that kind of number. Obviously, you could change this over time, and I will put this in the conservative category. Obviously the composition of our balance sheet will change of time, loans will go up. We need to meet the new LCR and Basel III requirements, CIO has reinvestment here of $40 billion. They have to invest, every year, probably, if you want to estimate it, an additional $20 billion to $30 billion of additional deposits. That flow will be invested in the things we think have the most logic for the Company in terms of liquid asset buffers, return of risk weighted assets, et cetera. Loans will be our priority, by the way. This is not our priority. We want to grow our businesses, but we do have this money to invest. Obviously, the more liquid assets we buy, we might reduce NII a little bit, but it also reduces RWA, and there's not a complete offset but it's close. Over time, there's a pretty good chance we'll increase duration. Rates are going to go up again, you'll probably see us go longer in the curve and earn back more NII. So this is where we try to manage that all the time, and do the right fairly conservative thing for the Company. Next page shows you the investments. I've already mentioned kind of the green line at the top, the Treasury deployment and the cash deposit with banks is mostly central banks, reverse repo, I told you, government securities, they do have some very short-term AFS securities and then you can see below how we break out this. I'm not going to go through the detail here. If you want, later, on you can call Investor Relations, get some more detail. I want to point out two things. 80% of it is either government backed, US government agency credit or better. The only other thing I want to point out is every investment has risk. This concept that somehow you can buy Treasuries and think you might not lose money, you can buy credit, you might not lose money. You can buy mortgages, you might not lose money. Any of them, you have to make a decision of where you want to put your Company in this, and the future's always different. Now that we have Basel III, you might know that Basel III accumulated OCI goes into your capital. So obviously you have to invest, being careful about how much capital might swing around. As time goes on, we will [move on] through this book a little bi We still think it's fairly conservative. On the capital planning side, the first comp shows you net income that was just reported, $4.96 billion. These are your analyst estimates now. I'm taking your estimates for the Company from third quarter and fourth quarter and you can see your estimates for the 2013 and 2014. I just want to point out, we hope to beat all of them. All those numbers on that page, can't promise that, but we hope to. The next line down, RWA is our estimate, we're constantly estimating Basel 2.5 with NPR, et cetera in there, and we have run-off and model mitigation, a whole bunch of things. That's our best estimate today. If you look at the bottom line, our Tier 1 common goes from $7.9 billion today, this is no stock buyback, $8.5 billion the third quarter, $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter, $10.5 billion by the end of 2013, $12 billion by the end of 2014. IE, we have a lot of capital generation. That's why we think it's a logical thing to buy back stock. You could buy back, if you said, if you were my Board of Directors, you would say, how much stock you want to buy back, we can get to 9% Basel III by the end of 2013 and buy $23 billion, we can get to 9.5% and buy $15 billion. So clearly, we have the ability. What are we going to do? We would like to buy back stock, but after discussions with the Federal Reserve, we need to work with the Federal Reserve, the Board has determined not to buy back stock until two things take place. We finish the Board review, I think it's a logical thing, so we come to the conclusion with the Board review and we find no other major stuff, which I don't expect to find, and we submit a new capital plan to the Fed, only as to repurchase, not to dividends. (inaudible) And hopefully, if all goes well, we can start buying back stocks early in the fourth quarter. The dividend will continue to be 30%. In the past, we've said to you all that we hope to have a 30% pay-out ratio. It is possible when you look at these numbers, strategically, you might raise that ratio some years down the road, but we'll decide that when we get there. And we're in a strong trajectory to meet the 9.5%, we have plenty of capital and plenty of capital generation. In spite of this accident, this event does not change what I think has been a bedrock of JPMorgan Chase for the last five or six years. We believe in a Fortress balance sheet, and conservative balance sheet management. We always believe in high capital. Through this whole crisis, you never saw our capital go down. We believe in conservative funding, I won't go through detail there, a lot of liquidity. Strong reserves. I would tell you, we believe generally in conservative accounting principles. We don't like to deceive ourselves about whether they're earning money or not, and obviously, this thing is also a little bit of an exception there. I already mentioned the bond, we have fairly conservative balance sheet management and asset liability management. Our earnings, the real reason we're here is to grow our Company. We think we have a strong and diversified business model. It's been a source of strength to this company, not a source of weakness, particularly in the storm. We have great earnings power, we still think the earnings power, if you adjust for all kind of the ins and outs, about $24 billion a year. We think we have some of the best franchises in our businesses in the world, almost every single one of them. They may not be the best, but I think they're damn close, and we think we have a very disciplined and detailed management team, all of whom are sorry that we missed this thing. The way we run our business day-to-day, we have pretty good businesses and management teams. This slide I like to look at because it just shows the buildup over the last six years on our book value, our tangible book value. I think our book value is clean, with strong reserves and strong accounting and good loans and good assets and things like that. You can see throughout this whole crisis, this never stops growing. So we were able to grow in difficult times and I think it's a sign of strength, not a sign of weakness. It was driven by diversified businesses, confident investing in businesses, building what we consider to be market leading franchises and maintain our conservative principles. So to wrap it up, we are not proud at this moment but we are proud of our company. We're not making light of this error, but we do think it's an isolated event. One of the reasons you do hold capital is for known and unknown events. Obviously this one we shot ourselves in the foot. That is one reason you have capital, for things you are surprised about. We learned a lot. I can tell you this has shaken our Company to the core, and what happened here is that most of the management team went back and said let's redouble our efforts to make sure we're running a great Company. We're granular, thoughtful, disciplined in every possible. We could never say that we won't make mistakes. We operate in a risk business. So say you're doing -- you think precisely that does not mean we make mistakes, hopefully they'll be small and few and far between. We have a great franchise which we never stopped growing in this crisis, serving our clients through tough times and we think we have great growth opportunities going forward. With that, I will turn it over to Doug Braunstein, who will take you through the regular earnings presentation. Thank you.
MIKE CAVANAGH, CEO, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: Thanks, Doug. So I hope everybody's coffee has kicked in and mine as well. We're going to spend a little while here going through the task force update. So for those on the phone or on the web, if you go to the next section, is what it's called. So in the room here, I'll dive right in on slide number 1, which describes the management review that's been under way for the past two months. So my job has been to lead this firm-wide response, and conduct a rigorous review of the events leading up to the losses, assess what went wrong, and mobilize the Company to make the necessary fixes happen. While some work remains, I'm glad to say that the scope and intensity of what we've already done allows me to give you today what I think is a very clear picture of what happened and what we've done about it. I have to say that it's been an incredible effort by many people, and I just want to thank everyone who's been involved in getting this work done to get us here. Now what I'm going to do, is go through this presentation in three sections. First, we're going to spend a bunch of time just walking through some facts. Then we'll go through observations and implications of those facts. And then finally, I'll bring it to a close with the remediation actions that we've taken in response to all this. So if you start, let's begin on slide 2. That is just a summary of the key findings of the review. There are five key observations. The first is the actual cause of the losses. And the other observations are things that, had we done them better, may have reduced the size of the losses, allowing us to detect issues earlier. The first one, which is the cause, is that CIO judgments, execution and escalation were poor in the first quarter. Second, the level of scrutiny of CIO did not evolve commensurate with its increased complexity. Third, the dedicated risk management team supporting CIO was ineffective in dealing with the challenges of this portfolio. Fourth, that risk limits in CIO were not granular enough, and fifth, that the model, the approval and implementation of synthetic credit VaR model that we'll talk about, that happened in the quarter, was poorly done. So with that overview of these observations, now let's slowly go through the pertinent facts that these support. So on slide 3 is some historical context on the synthetic credit portfolio itself. The portfolio's primary purpose had been to provide a partial offset to losses we would suffer elsewhere in CIO, and the Company, in a stressed credit environment. The portfolio got started about five years ago. It was generally short credit. But also included some long positions in order to reduce the cost of carrying credit protection. And consistent with its objective, the portfolio produced gains in the stressed period of 2008 to 2010, and was breakeven or positive from each year from 2007 to 2011, and all-in, it generated about $2 billion in gains during that period. So next on slide 4, now we get into a summary of the first-quarter 2012 transformation of the portfolio that led to the losses. In late 2011, CIO was directed to reduce the synthetic credit portfolio's risk and risk weighted assets. That direction came as part of the annual budgeting process, in which we develop the firm's capital plans including our glide path to Basel III. In the second bullet, I'll attempt to explain what it appears the synthetic credit team and CIO hoped to do. And that was, to move their portfolio's risk position from a net short position to a neutral one, while reducing risk weighted assets in the process. They also hoped to retain some protection against Corporate credit defaults which was a synthetic credit portfolio's historical mission. So a lot of things going on that they were trying to accomplish, and found it difficult to find a balance that they liked. To simplify what they did, it amounted to them going long investment grade indices while increasing short positions in junior tranches in high yield indices. And the size of the portfolio grew dramatically as they continued to add positions later in the quarter, when they were struggling to balance the portfolio, as the market began to move against them. So a question of why they didn't just pursue an outright reduction of the portfolio. And it appears, and that's all it is, an appearance, that they thought about it a bit but they believed that it would be more expensive than the approach they chose, which obviously proved to be wrong, and were focused on thinking about high execution costs to reduce the portfolio in size and the loss carry of a reduced portfolio, and so they went ahead with the approach they had. That's my best shot at describing what it seems they were trying to do. And now you move to the third bullet where you see what we now know, which is what they did do, was increase the size and complexity of the portfolio dramatically in the first quarter, and along with it, the sensitivity to a variety of risks which you can see listed there, all of which contributed in some part to the losses and Jamie touched on some of these earlier on. On slide 5, I just give a graphic representation of basically the same thing, which is the growth of the portfolio in the first quarter. On the left, you see the total notional size of the portfolio, with the red dots being the net of long and short notionals, which as you can see, tripled in the first quarter. You can't look at this slide and fully understand the risk of the portfolio. But what it does show is that the significantly increased size and complexity of the portfolio left little margin for error when the expected pricing relationships across the portfolio began to break down and generate losses. It was a very risky approach they took that should have been discussed and vetted at more senior levels but it was not. So now, for the next three slides, what I'm going to do is lay out some key events that happened during three sequential time periods. So the first one, slide 6, covers the first period, and that is from the beginning of 2012 to late March, March 23, by which point the cake was fully baked on this thing and essentially all of the loss-making positions were already on the books. So during this period, what you see on this slide is three key events I want to talk about. The first one, was that certain CIO level risk limits got exceeded, and how those exceptions were handled. These types of business level limits are common across the Company, and when they are exceeded, the independent business unit risk managers are responsible for reviewing the reasons for the excess and either granting relief or ensuring that action is taken to get back inside the limits. Specifically, two CIO-level credit spread widening limits were exceeded over the course of the quarter. In January, a measurement of the impact of credit spread widening that ignored correlations across instruments exceeded its limits. This was reviewed by a CIO's market risk officer, who granted relief from the limit on the basis that the measure was an unsophisticated tool for measuring risk in the circumstances. Then secondly, the other one there was on March 23rd, the second CIO-level credit spread widening limit was exceeded, and this was obviously of little use as a control measure since it occurred after the positions were already put on. Now, the second event you see on the slide here in the middle bullet was the approval of a new synthetic credit VaR model in late January. This was approved by the independent model review group in corporate risk management. The week before the new model was implemented, John Hogan, the new Chief Risk Officer and Jamie were asked to sign off on a temporary increase of firm-wide VaR in an e-mail, which noted that a CIO VaR model was soon to be approved, which was expected to lower VaR, and they assented and went ahead with that approval. The problem with this second event here, which is why it's on this slide, relates to the model approval itself. Again, this was done by the model review group, despite reasons for concern about the weak operational environment supporting the model, which we'll come back to later on. And then the third event on this slide was the February 29 CIO business review with folks from Corporate, and the CIO attendees at that meeting indicated that the portfolio, the synthetic credit portfolio was well-positioned and that RWA reduction was on track and raised no other issues. That's it for the key events up to the period of March 23, and that is a period by which all the positions were substantially on the books that led to the losses and the portfolio transformed. Now let's go on to slide 7, and move on to the next time period I want to talk about. This is the period from then, March 23 then to the April 13 earnings call. So first, the portfolio experiences losses in late March and early April. Around this time, market visibility of the synthetic credit positions becomes a concern, particularly after press reports on April 6. At that point, Doug and Jamie asked for a review of the portfolio in preparation for the earnings release a few days later. Ina spear-headed the review with engagement by John Hogan, Doug Braunstein, and others. The main output of that review was forward scenario analysis that produced a probable P&L range for the second quarter on the portfolio from positive $350 million to negative $250 million, with a bias to the positive end. So at that time, the group got comfortable that the portfolio's risk was manageable, though in need of heightened attention going forward, and assurances to that effect were provided to Jamie and Doug. Let me make a few additional points about this review. First, that analysis was led by Ina, which made sense, as she was very capable of driving a review of an activity in her area of responsibility. If there was a question about something like this in TSS for example, I'd fully expect to lead the charge on bottoming it out, as would other operating committee members for their businesses. The second point is that Ina, in turn, relied on the managers and traders responsible for the portfolio, and who knew it best to produce the supporting analysis at that stage over those few days, and hindsight obviously their views may have been unduly influenced that by their conviction that the market's awareness of their positions was causing aberrations in pricing that would reverse. I'll also just say here that the VaR model was not a focus during the pre-earnings release review, because there were no indication at that stage it wasn't working properly. It's a backward-looking indicator and actual losses had already prompted demands for the forward-looking scenario analysis that was being done. On April 13, this period ends and we announce our first-quarter results. Moving on to slide 8. This is the set of facts for the period between the earnings release and the launch of the management review. In late April, losses pick up and the heightened monitoring that followed the earnings call gets taken to another level, when a senior team from Corporate Risk is sent to examine the portfolio from the bottom up. They begin providing daily updates and constructing independent analysis of the portfolio that becomes the basis for risk measurements that the new CIO team picks up a few weeks later. It's during this period that problems with the new VaR model are discovered. We used the old model for the VaR number in the 10-Q, and disclosed that we had used the new model on April 13. This event has caused us to tighten up our procedures around model changes and disclosures going forward, by the way. We filed the first quarter 10-Q on Thursday, May 10 and held the investor call that evening with an update on the synthetic credit portfolio, and finally on Monday, May 14, Matt Zames is announced as the new CIO and our management review is launched. That's it for the facts on slide 9, we transition from those facts which you just see summarized on the left to the observations they support on the right, which is what I have covered at the beginning, and now let's spend a little time going through each one of those observations in a bit more detail. So on slide 10, is the first one which is the observation that CIO judgment, execution, and escalation were poor. So first, the trading approach itself was poorly conceived, reviewed and executed. As we saw in the facts, the portfolio grew to a perilous size, with numerous embedded risks that the team did not understand, and were not equipped to manage. The second bullet on the page is about insularity. Even within CIO, the discussion of the portfolio stayed in the chain of managers with direct responsibility for it. A robust review among peer leaders in CIO would have provided for a discussion and challenge on the business side, which is what I'm accustomed to seeing across the management teams in this company, and it didn't happen here. And this was again compounded by the failure to surface issues related to the synthetic credit portfolio in the February business review with Corporate. Finally, the CIO-led review and analysis of the portfolio in advance of the April 13 earnings call was poorly managed, resulting in the view that potential losses were manageable, that the portfolio was balanced, and would recover. Now, before leaving each of these findings I'm just going to comment quickly on the remediation actions that relate to it, that we'll get to later, and through this, one of those fixes are the people changes that have been made in all the relevant CIO roles and a complete revamping on the management processes in CIO. So the second observation is that the level of scrutiny that CIO faced did not evolve as the complexity of the synthetic credit portfolio increased. So some of the contributing factors here was the belief and experience that the core activities of CIO were managed appropriately, contributing to the unit's successful track record. Second was the capability of and experience of Ina herself, and third was the modest but positive results of the synthetic credit portfolio historically. So as a result, we collectively ended up with a level of scrutiny that fell short of the high standards we apply to our client businesses, especially as the complexity increased. Moving on to slide 12, the third observation is that CIO risk management was ineffective in its responsibility to the synthetic credit portfolio. I'd acknowledge some factors that presented challenges for the CIO risk management team including what in hindsight was the lack of quality resources and a less robust risk committee supporting the risk team. Nonetheless, the CIO risk team failed to meet reasonable expectations in my mind. First, a primary responsibility of the business level risk team is establishing adequate risk limits. In this case, tighter, more appropriate limits would have forced more discussion and debate about this portfolio, and if needed, would have prompted escalation to more senior levels. In fairness to the CIO risk team, they had an effort under way to improve the risk limit structure for CIO but it was too late to matter. Second, the CIO risk team did not perform adequately when it came to the VaR model approval and implementation. I'll cover that in a couple of slides. Third, CIO risk wasn't forceful enough in challenging the front office, and they never developed a sufficient understanding of the risk of the portfolio to escalate concerns to senior risk leaders outside CIO during the first quarter. Now to remediate this, we've added new people in key roles. We've also significantly strengthened the risk committee framework that covers CIO and other Corporate sector activities. So on slide 13, observations, number four, which is that risk limits in CIO were not sufficiently granular. So this is a critical one and we saw it in the facts on slide 6 that we gave ourselves too few opportunities to engage risk or other senior people as would have been the case if we had a well-designed limit structure around this portfolio. First, there were no risk limits specific to the synthetic credit portfolio. The limits applied to more aggregated portfolios, often at the level of CIO which was clearly inadequate. Obviously, though, what was needed was granular position level limits for the portfolio itself. And I'd just say that in our Investment Bank credit derivatives business, the limits are already very granular. I believe that had the synthetic credit portfolio been risk managed under equivalent standards, it would not have experienced the unchecked transformation and growth that led to the losses. As for remediation here, we now have granular risk limits for all CIO, and verified they are in place where needed across the firm. Moving to slide 14, is the final observation, is that the synthetic credit VaR model approval and implementation were inadequate. So there's been some speculation here that this model was approved abruptly and by CIO alone, but that's not true. The fact is that CIO began working in consultation with the independent model review group in Corporate risk in mid-2011 to upgrade the VaR model used for synthetic credit to a more accurate model that captured correlation risk as required for Basel 2.5 compliance, which we did not have with the old model, and we obviously wanted to get. The expectation of all parties involved in the model approval was that the new model would lower measured VaR on the basis of the improvement in the calculation methodology, together with the infrequent band breaks of the old model, which suggested that it produced conservative calculation of VAR. So a fundamental problem with the VaR process was a lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities for each element of the process across the model review group, the CIO risk group, and the CIO front office. And the primary problem in the end, though, was sloppiness and bad execution in implementing the new model, operational problems which included incorrect data feeds and certain calculation mistakes resulted in a VaR that was lower than what the approved model would have produced. A properly implemented model would still have lowered VaR compared to the old model but not by as much, so it would still have taken us a bit of time to catch the overall problems, but as we have said, it probably delayed us a little bit. To remediate here, we strengthened the procedures around significant model approval and implementations. So slide 15, another transition here, so now we've just finished up reviewing the observations on the left side of the slide. And now we'll touch in a little more detail on a couple of the major remediation actions that foreshadowed a bit. On slide 16, moving to that, first we have what is effectively a complete revamping of the CIO unit itself. On the people front, that includes new CIO management team members, including Matt himself, plus the head of CIO Europe, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer. All of them are very highly regarded, and have substantial experience at our Company. In terms of governance, the new team has instituted a robust committee structure, new review processes and better reporting, which will provide for better discussion and debate to ensure mistakes like this one that occurred here don't happen again. And in terms of CIOs mandates, matters refocusing on the core mission of managing the AFS investment portfolio. The synthetic credit activity has been shut down and liquidated portfolio transferred to the Investment Bank in order to be better managed. On slide 17, you see a summary of the risk management remediation actions both for CIO and the firm. For CIO, as I've mentioned, we have a new Chief Risk Officer, and have added resources to support his efforts. This new CIO will have responsibility for all the areas of the Corporate sector, not just CIO. As we learned from this event, all activities, outside our client businesses need robust risk management coverage, and by broadening the mandate of this new Chief Risk Officer, we've accomplished that. Next is risk governance. As I've said, we've created a much more robust risk committee for all activities in Corporate that is modeled after the committees in our client businesses. It includes significant representation by senior executives and subject matter experts from outside CIO. The committee has already met numerous times, and it's completed detailed reviews of the activities of CIO, ensuring risk parameters are consistent with the newly refocused mandate. And as for risk limits, we've introduced proper limits on all other CIO activities. Across the rest of the firm, we thoroughly reviewed the market risk limit structures to see if relaxed granularity elsewhere and found them to be in good shape. Finally we bolstered the policies for dealing with risk limit exceptions by requiring higher levels of escalation and more frequent reviews. Slide 18 summarizes the remediation of the model approval and implementation and monitoring processes. So here, we've clarified the roles and responsibilities between the firm-wide model review group, and the line of business risk management functions. For the model review group, which sits in Corporate, in addition to reviewing and approving the VaR calculation framework, which is their core activity, the group must also assess now the quality of the analytical testing and the soundness of the model operating environment, whoever it is that's responsible for that. We've also formed up a new team inside model review that will monitor model related responsibilities across the risk management function firm-wide. They've been under way, and they've already reviewed all market risk VaR models, and confirmed that data integrity and operating environments are sound. And then for the lines of business, we have clarified their responsibilities across all aspects of model governance, including post implementation monitoring, and we have heightened the expectations for model oversight through the line of business risk committees. So finally on remediation, I'd just say that I just reviewed the remediations that are the ones that directly address the observations from the management review of CIO. But I should add that we picked up a lot of other learnings along the way during this work, and that we're acting on those things as well to make the Company better. Now just to wrap it up, on slide 19, I'll wrap it up by saying that based on everything this team and I have examined and reviewed in the past two months, I believe that the synthetic credit event is an isolated failure. That's both because circumstances in CIO were unique but also because of the thorough shakedown of the whole Company that we did to be certain that we weren't making similar mistakes elsewhere. I'd say, in closing, that our management team has always been and continues to be very highly-focused on managing risk and this event has caused us to step up our game everywhere. Thanks for listening to this. We're going to move to Q&A now. And while Jamie and Doug rejoin for that, I'm just going to get us started with a couple of topics that you see to get Q&A going. To just pick up where Doug already covered a lot on the restatements. I just want to link it back to the work that I've done. So this slide gives some supporting information on the restatements that Doug covered earlier. All his numbers are the ones that are in there. The context is, because it's really the management review effort that's created the highly unusual circumstances we were faced with, in making the decision to restate the first quarter. Remember, we started the management review on May 14, which was a couple of days after we -- all the work supporting the 10-Q filing on May 10 was completed. As I described, the management review fact finding has been very exhaustive. We've done obviously lots of e-mails being reviewed. But also, tens of thousands of voice tapes, many of them in foreign languages. And so it's taken time to work our way through, and work continues. But a broadest of determination in the past few days, that as Doug said, we don't have sufficient comfort that for the first quarter the trader marks met the requirements of being where the traders thought they could exit their positions. I'll just point out though, that's even though the marks were generally within the bid ask spread, which is what otherwise is acceptable for GAAP. Given the unusual circumstances we've taken the conservative approach to restate, bringing the marks to the VCG's midst of external mid-market benchmarks. Next, I just want to say a few things on the people side. First, on clawbacks. So employee-related actions for CIO managers here, slide 22. Now, Jamie's going to talk about Ina in a minute. I'll talk about the several other managers, all of the managers in London with direct responsibility for synthetic credit portfolio, are now separated from the firm. None are receiving severance. And no 2012 incentive compensation. We've made the decision to claw back compensation from each of these individuals, and that amount is the maximum permitted, we've invoked that. It represents approximately two years of total annual compensation for each individual, covering stock and options. We took into account, what's taken into account was a broad set of factors. I'll just make the point that the balance of factors for any individual in this balances differently but all ended up at the same result of a full clawback. The Board's reviewed all of these decisions. I'll just say further, because there may be questions on people actions, what's covered here is the three London managers with direct responsibility for synthetic credit, but there's several other changes in senior people in CIOs, some of whom have been reassigned to more appropriate roles, and others who will be leaving the firm. We believe we're taking all the appropriate people actions in a timely manner, but beyond what I've told you here, we're not going to be providing more details on people actions, and obviously not going to be talking about individuals. Then finally, on 23, I've got a Board statement to read on compensation determinations. And forget the three people I just covered. As I said, Jamie will cover Ina. Advancing the slide here. For all other individuals, and that includes Jamie, the 2012 performance year compensation and clawback, if appropriate, will be determined in the ordinary course, considering among other things the factors you see listed which is Company, unit and individual performance on a absolute and relative basis, the achievement of non-financial objectives which of course are the same things we would always consider in a total picture on compensation. Of course, involvement in and responsibility for the CIO matter will be included in that. Just an added point, we're only going to make public information about what we do on clawbacks if it's required. Let me hand it over to Jamie, who wants to make a comment about Ina, and then we'll go to Q&A.
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks, Mike. Let me just say a word about Ina Drew. I have enormous respect for Ina as a professional and as a person. She has made some incredible contributions to this company. If she decided to retire, I got several letters from former Chairmen who talk about her contribution. One even said she saved the Company, in his judgment. In my experience, she has acted with integrity and tried to do what was right for the Company at all times, even though she was part of this mistake, and I believe that is true here, as well. In that spirit, Ina came forward and offered to give up a very significant amount of her past compensation, which is equivalent to the maximum clawback amount. With that, I'll turn it over to Q&A. Questions and Answers
JAMIE DIMON: This does not affect the earnings power of the Company at all. The $24 billion would still be accurate. We can probably show those numbers. We didn't put them up there, but we can probably show you the numbers -- almost the same we showed you last time. There are a lot of those where we are today minus the burden in Mortgage.
JAMIE DIMON: We think -- we've been fairly consistent, we think we kind of have a roller coaster ride here. You see progress -- two steps forward, one step back. We still think they're going to muddle through, but it may not be in the form or fashion or timetable we all would prefer. The number's up there, we went from $12 billion to $6 billion of net exposure. We think that's a rather good number. When we stress test, we think our risk is, we talk about a potential loss of $3 billion. In a bad scenario, it could be worse. In a complete extreme scenario, like a falling apart of the whole European Union, the important thing to us is we continue to conduct business there. We have a lot of clients. We've been in Italy and Spain for 100 years or so. We're going to do that carefully. Obviously, we've been doing more hedging of the exposures there. And that decision we make periodically over time.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we showed a lot of numbers, showed the risk itself is down two-thirds, 70%, 80%. Depending how you measure it. [In the IB], it doesn't have to lose money at all. We said the extreme stress scenarios, simulated stress scenarios, which would be a Euro crisis, a credit crunch, a 99.9 statistical analysis could be as high as $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion. Does not mean we expect it. I would be surprised if it got that big.
JAMIE DIMON: There was $2 billion of profit in this book over a four- or five-year period. We don't -- we didn't assume any of it going forward at all. It's not like we're taking a lot of risk and assuming big profits. We were not. That was not in our numbers. That doesn't change the $24 billion or anything like that. We're not derisking the AFS portfolio. When it's fully invested, about $250 billion; it has a 2.6% yield. You can go buy Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae today at 3.25%, so, you can easily extend duration. We're at very short duration. Extend duration, earn more NII. I say, the portfolio's actually conservative. Will be a source of higher earnings, if and when rates go up. So, this will not affect the earnings power of the Company at all.
JAMIE DIMON: The Investment Bank is doing what it's supposed to do. They were not asked to take down any other risk because they took in synthetic credit. They're going to manage synthetic credit, because that's what they do. But the rest of the business is running exactly the way it was before. They constantly manage their own risk exposures.
JAMIE DIMON: All I can say, is like all of these things, a lot of people doing exams. We're totally open with regulators and investigators. The other thing, I'd be a little patient if I were you. Not everything is the same. It's going to take a while. Not all companies are in the same position. I just wouldn't make too many assumptions at this point.
JAMIE DIMON: The 7.9% is we fully phase in everything up front. What we're saying for the 9%, you actually fully phased in the run-off stuff in some of the models we know we're going to do. We would get another 1 point back within the next two years. I'm trying to show apples-to-apples.
JAMIE DIMON: That 9.5% was the end of 2013. And was like 10.5% for 2014; if we don't buy back stock, it's like 10.5% and 12.5%. Go right to that slide, and you can see it. That's without stock buyback. That's only taking advantage of mitigating items the year they actually happen.
JAMIE DIMON: I can never prove a negative. Mike went through what -- our expense controls and disciplines, which we feel pretty good about. We can't prove to you that, because you're not going to see it. We think this is isolated. We think the controls in Europe are just -- Mike was running through controls around the country, around the world. We think they're pretty good.
JAMIE DIMON: You're making a good point. Doug showed the numbers, like eight quarters of continuous middle market loan growth. Anecdotally, I hear that from other companies too, not all other banks but a lot of the banks. I hear from a lot of the banks small business loan growth. The fact is, the underpinnings of the American economy aren't that bad. Corporate America, middle market companies, small business are okay -- there's a lot of liquidity. There's not a huge order book, so sales aren't growing dramatically. We have slow, modest growth, and we are starting to see it in our calculations. Some of what we're getting is market share gains. Remember, we did middle market -- we weren't doing middle market banking in California and now we do. We weren't doing small business in California, now we do because [of our position]. We are gaining share in some of our businesses -- credit card, middle market, small business, IB's holding share.
JAMIE DIMON: So, I think, last time we spoke about mortgage, we think it's kind of well -- we've really done a good job there, and that could change over time. We put a lot away from mortgage over time. This quarter, you see the 10-Q, you get to see the 10-Q will now show litigation expense is like $300 million. We try to keep up with reserving for things we know about. This quarter, we had some big ins and outs. It isn't like just one thing that happens.
JAMIE DIMON: We're going to be resubmitting in a week or two.
JAMIE DIMON: And we're getting our instructions about what that process is going to be.
JAMIE DIMON: Whatever it is, we think we can accommodate and get it done and resubmit it. Like I said, I hope both the Board governance -- the Board is doing its review, so I can't say when the Board is going to end its review, but I'm hopeful that the Board review and the capital plan are done in such a way that by early in the fourth quarter, we can buy back stock if we want.
JAMIE DIMON: I wrote in my Chairman's Letter that at tangible book value, I think our stock is a great buy.
JAMIE DIMON: The $3 billion was my estimate after tax. It was $5 billion pretax. I did it with my own methodologies. I said it was a bad outcome; it's not the worst outcome. If you said that Europe unraveled, the Euro falls apart, I think it could be worse than that. The IB just recently, the IB is constantly looking at these -- for the Company. TSS does it. Their number recently would be more like $3 billion. We have a Euro command center. We know exactly what we're doing; if something goes wrong, we're prepared to deal with it. We don't have to necessarily have losses at all. The issue with Europe, and the complexes with Europe are what contracts apply, how they apply, who leaves the Euro, what currencies you're paid in, what does that do for losses in the country? So, there are these complex things, but those numbers would still be rough estimates of a bad outcome, but not the worst outcome.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, this Company is the same Company that went through 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011. Similarly to Bear Stearns and WaMu, and we had record earnings the last year. We had record earnings the year before. It's likely, if you look to your own estimates, we're going to have record earnings this year. We have gained market share at investment banking, and TSS and asset management. Our commercial bank and small business and middle market. We're just not doing a great job marketing the Company. We're going to sit back and try to make this a more attractive Company for you all. We made a mistake. We completely disclosed the mistake. We've denuded ourselves in front of you. We're in better shape than we were before. CIO was not a place we expected a mistake. We made the mistake. I can't prove a negative. So, you all can ask me all day long, I can not prove a negative. We believe we've got very good controls, and very good people in place. Look at the results, by the way.
JAMIE DIMON: Because we have very granular limits. We've got risk committees, credit committees, audit committees. We try to do a very good job. I think it's silly for anyone in the business world to think you're not going to make mistakes. It is not possible in the real world. That's only possible in a fictional world. I just think the mistakes should be smaller, fewer and far between -- this being an exception.
JAMIE DIMON: It's not the nature of the instruments. A lot of these things are traded on exchanges. Most of the indexes, you can go buy and sell in the marketplace easily. Most of them are on clearing houses, and if you want to see, you can see them. I think this portfolio became very big and very complex. That is true. It should never, ever, ever have gotten that big and that complex. And at May 10, the first thing I said -- it was too big, it was un-vetted, it shouldn't have been done, it was illiquid. It was bad. We should have caught it earlier.
JAMIE DIMON: That's true for all financial instruments.
JAMIE DIMON: Not at all. The AFS portfolio is held for sale, so, it's marked to market in the equity account, but not marked-to-market. We think you should be allowed to portfolio hedge. We're not going to do something like this again. But we think a pure portfolio hedge is not necessarily a bad thing. So, we all talk about Europe. One of the quick ways, you want to go hedge Europe, right now you get on the phone, you can buy $1 billion of [protection] on European, or 120 European credit names. That is a good thing if you want to protect yourselves in Europe. Not that complex. So, if Volcker changes the future for a whole bunch of things, we'll adapt to that, whatever that is.
JAMIE DIMON: As a business matter, we'll be fine with whatever the Basel III numbers are. It is a little complex. It does create all these things about mezzanine pieces, how securitization is going to work with the FICO score. Like FICO at a 660 would be very bad under Basel III. So, everyone would have to modify their business plan because of Basel III. It won't change the Mortgage, our ability to be in the Mortgage business.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not sure what you're talking about. (multiple speakers) I'm not going to comment on that.
JAMIE DIMON: We're hopeful that when the Board finishes its review, the regulators get to look at everything that Mike has said and done, ask their questions, file the CCAR, we're hopeful that by the first quarter, we'll be able to buy back stock. We think the numbers justify it, we think the performance of the Company justifies it, but we want to go through that process, it's a prudent thing to do, and if something stops that from happening, then so be it.
JAMIE DIMON: Was that pretax?
JAMIE DIMON: Those numbers are after tax.
MIKE CAVANAGH: They are refreshing and updating their scenario. We're going to run a new scenario pursuant to their guidelines.
JAMIE DIMON: What I said is we're hopeful. And I've been wrong before.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not going to comment on anything like that right now.
JAMIE DIMON: One disclosure you're going to see is this AFS portfolio's yielding 2.6%, but this quarter it's going to be 2.47%, that is hedging effectiveness. It's really still [using] 2.6%. So, (inaudible) just a few hedging effectiveness went in, and it goes against the asset.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I would say it's something that the complexity of synthetic credit was there over five years, and there were things that obviously we could have caught it sooner, but it didn't until the circumstances of the first quarter get us. But the overall mistake was allowing something that wasn't like the rest of the ALM type of activities to get housed inside CIO. That had one form of risk management structure, and then put something new in that required a whole different type of risk wrapped around it, and didn't do it at the time.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, we don't run a business in models. And if you do run a business in models, you will be dead. It doesn't work. VaR is one model. We use tons of other models, and I think Mike pointed out, the right way to do it is have lots of other granular limits -- notional amount limits, credit spread limits, single name limits, all these things. VaR is just one. VaR does not capture underlying changes in underwriting, it doesn't capture changes in correlations, it's only backward looking. It's a data point that helps you manage your business. That's all it is. Now, having said that, Mike, we've got to do a better job implementing some of these models.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's the process of (inaudible) models, not the models themselves. That's the finding there. The granularity risk, those are the two big take-aways, if you look at the findings, that I would say, is get the right limits around the activity, one. That's not necessarily a VaR model or any one given type of activity, but if we're going to put things in, we've got to have belt and suspenders to make sure we approve it for the right reasons, and have the right operational support around it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think we've brought, certainly put a lot of attention on it ourselves, and I think the take-aways that we saw was this just bolstering all processes around model governance, implementation approval, a new team. We took 25-year veteran risk manager in charge of a new group that's really going to lead up, watching model activities, all parts of process, because really the mistake we made here was roles and responsibilities. So, whereas, I would say we're very good in particularly our Investment Bank, which the heaviest user of models; we've got very robust in-business market risk teams, that have the handoff of dealing with parallel testing, back testing, running the operational model themselves. CIO was weaker in that regard. So, when you have the interaction between the independent model of review group, and the market risk teams in the business, again, a particular mistake here. That's a policy and procedure thing that we've tightened up, and John Hogan's done a lot in the past month.
JAMIE DIMON: CCAR is not VaR dependent. Stress testing is more important. We do extensive stress testing. And so, to me, you've got to get that right. So, CCAR has embedded in it, is one test. We do hundreds of stress tests, and obviously we should have done stress test in this particular portfolio better, too.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not talking about going down to 1%, but we're getting near the end of the margin compression from the yield curve. If I remember correctly, about a year or two ago, we might lose another $400 million or $500 million, and then it flattens out. If the 10 goes down more, it's even more. We're short -- most banks have much longer duration than we do. We could easily today put on -- change what we're doing, and put on $50 billion in mortgage at 3% and earn a lot more. If you really believe that, we could change our structure to earn back some of that income, in fact, far more than what you might lose from --.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think -- most of the effect of a yield curve has gone away. If it stays like this forever, we're still going to earn about what we're earning. It isn't like you have to deal with a negative every year after every year. How you do your loans and your deposits and a lot of things on our balance sheet, which earn very little, because we're almost doing them as a service for clients, you might do less of that. But you still have $200 billion of Treasury assets we have. We're earning 5 basis points on that. We don't need to keep those deposits. We may modify that. But you'll change your pricing, your products, your services, to try to earn a fair return on capital.
JAMIE DIMON: So, basically, if you did the number today, you might show a gap, but that gap is easy for us to fix by just changing our asset mix. We will be LCR-compliant by reinvesting the AFS portfolio or doing their slight different things. We want to see the final rules before we start swinging the balance sheets all over the place. We'll be fine. We're a very liquid Company.
JAMIE DIMON: We ask that question all the time, but we're actually, believe it or not, getting good returns right now. When you look at the returns in our businesses, a 15% return on tangible equity, the record earnings. So, could you do more? What we like to do is build the business -- bankers, services, clients, execution services, to grow our business over time, and we've been doing that. That's what we focus on, and we'll modify pricing, products and balance sheet to get a fair return.
JAMIE DIMON: It's very hard to add to the debate you read about every day. You're now reading about what they kind of need to do, and they need to do kind of all of them. Have a European bank regulator, a European bank scheme to stop bank runs, have some facility that could finance the Italian and Spanish sovereign debt in the meantime, and then fiscal union that people believe in. And we think you're going to see that kind of in fits and starts over time. Just be prepared for the roller coaster.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm going to do the second one first. I think it's a very small -- CIO is a very small part of that number. That's number one. Number two, there are very complex lending rules, which I don't want to go through here about derivatives, but we did do a presentation at one point showing exactly how derivatives net by counterparty. We would be happy to share that with you and take you through it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's a good question, Nancy. What we referred to there is, in late April, that's the stage at which John Hogan over there and a team of folks from outside CIO and across business went in to really sit on-site and pick the book apart. Prior to that, there was obviously work being done with senior risk folks, but looking through the lens of the CIO risk team. So, it took it to a different level of intrusion.
JAMIE DIMON: The CIO risk team did an inadequate job.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Sure. We obviously looked at all that. None of the people in CIO are on any form of formulas; the business is not on a formula. We obviously looked at compensation for what we were doing in CIO, relative to what you would see pay related to running a $350 billion fixed income portfolio. Can't obviously get in the minds of the individuals that -- in making individual decisions, but we look for evidence of particular things that were problematic around our compensation schemes, and found no particular issues.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, as you know, Investment Banking revenues are unpredictable by their nature. Whenever they come in with a low number, I would say -- well, it could be much higher. Right now, it looks similar to what it was last quarter. That can change at any one point in time. I think you see everywhere, business in Asia and Europe are down. America remains to be seen.
JAMIE DIMON: We share a lot of information with people who ask. The regulators are completely up-to-date on all of Mike's information. Right? They've been through this several --?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Absolutely. More than absolutely.
JAMIE DIMON: I beg to differ, okay? And there's huge strength in this Company that the units get from each other. We don't have the strategy of we're guessing at things. The Investment Bank serves the commercial bank. The TSS gets huge order flow to the Investment Bank. We think there's enormous amount of cross-sell. And we do it just as much as anybody else out there between the Consumer Bank, Small Business, Private Wealth Management, Credit Card, Mortgage, and our job is to do a great job serving clients, grow the business, and eventually the stock will reflect it. And so, I think also, people splitting off companies -- my whole life, is people splitting off the higher P, lower P. That's very short-term stuff. Have a strategy, execute on it, and build the business, that's how you build value. We don't feel great that we haven't done a great job for shareholders recently, that we completely acknowledge, but we're going to keep on building the Company, and one day the stock will reflect it. If the Board ever thought there were better strategies, that will be considered at the time.
JAMIE DIMON: Hundreds of small banks have gone bankrupt. Okay? Mono lines went bankrupt. (multiple speakers) You could argue the other way. There's a huge source of strength in how strong this Company is through all these storms, can do Bear Stearns and WaMu, do all these wonderful things. CIO was a mistake, and we're sorry.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: We have no special insight, okay?
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's the application of policies are the same across businesses, different applications.
JAMIE DIMON: A little bit. And you know what those things are. It's Europe, fiscal cliff in the United States. It's all those things would make you be a little more cautious. Again, I think we're going to earn money next year regardless of those things, whatever happens.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I can't speak for the regulators, but certainly they have been -- we have spent a lot of time with them to keep them informed, and obviously wanted to guide our work from the get-go in a way that was going to satisfy a lot of different constituencies.
JAMIE DIMON: They're going to do their own work as they should, and come to their own conclusions. The Board has an independent group which is still guiding the task force, and will come to its own conclusions, too.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, I mean, I don't think -- when we talk about formulas, individuals getting a cut of revenue, none of that existed, and I don't think that's a good thing. I think the kind of practices that are common in CIO are the same as what we do on our Investment Bank, is taking the totality of managers' subjective judgment of performance and a multi-year view of how good a person is doing their job over multiple years. All of that together with the pay practices of how we defer compensation, all are sound policies, and it's the application obviously that you have to get right. Matt, who is now running CIO, I'm sure will bring his own individual management style to doing that, but we didn't walk away with a feeling that there's anything different about that unit of the Company, or that the Company broadly should be doing differently around administering compensation.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no.
JAMIE DIMON: Double A plus, it's an AFS portfolio, it's not marked-to-market in the P&L. It's got a 3.7-year average life, it's 80% government guaranteed or government type of entity guaranteed. You're not going to have more volatility in it. If we have a small hedge there, and you see we hedge more in Europe, that's why we need the ability to hedge. Very little to do with AFS. The AFS subordinates the rest of the Company. Nothing would please us more than to reduce AFS and make some more great loans. They can't say --be paid just on the revenues of their profit, because they're not there for that. They're in the management of this portfolio. We need some very good people, there's $350 billion, it operates, I forget out of how many countries, and multiple currencies. We need some very good people managing that book, just like you would with PIMCO or Black Rock, big fixed income portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: Folks, thank you very much for spending some time with us. Better news next time.",0.46,-0.4260000000000007,0,0.08543360700269913,0.1157682553869352
38,Q2_2013,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website; and please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. So turning to page 1, we carried strong momentum into the second quarter, with net income of $6.5 billion and an EPS of $1.60 a share on revenue of $26 billion, up 13% year-on-year and flat versus a seasonally strong first quarter, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. And you can see on the page that we've highlighted several significant items up front here. A $950 million reserve release in mortgage. And this quarter we saw net charge-offs less than 50% of what they were a year ago. A $550 million reserve release in Card, with charge-offs remaining historically low; and $600 million of expenses for additional litigation reserves in Corporate. In addition, the results for the quarter included a $355 million DVA gain in the Corporate and Investment Bank. Outside of these four items, we had a number of other smaller items, both positive and negative in the quarter, which offset each other, many of which I'll call out as we go through the presentation. And we want to be very transparent with you, we don't count items like reserve releases and other non-core items when we think about our own performance. So if we adjust for all of these items both big and small, our return on tangible common equity would have been about 15%, reflecting strong underlying core performance. This quarter, a couple of important themes, the Markets environment in June, as well as several capital developments. But just a quick note on each. Rising long term rates and higher levels of volatility in June have an impact both on the quarter as well as in terms of our mortgage outlook guidance. Our Market businesses held up well in June and our Asset Management platform outperformed during the backup. And importantly, remember that given the firm's positioning, rising rates will drive significant benefits in higher NII over time. However, in the near term, higher long term rates and wider spreads drove a significant reduction in the unrealized gains in our securities portfolio, or a reduction in AOCI, which did impact Basel III capital negatively. Despite that impact, we were able to add to our capital and improve capital ratios as we began to realize some of the run-off and model benefits that we've previously guided you to. And finally, higher rates will have a significant impact on mortgage refi volumes and margins in the second half of the year. On capital, we've added a new page in the debt on leverage, which I'll cover in a moment; but our headline capital number is a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 9.3%, including the impact of the final Basel III capital rules approved this month by our regulators. In general, the approvals were the same or similar to the NPRs, and in that sense were broadly in line with our expectations, including the confirmation of no exception for AOCI. The estimated impact on our ratio was a modest benefit. So on page 3 let me take you through the details. We ended the quarter with Basel III Tier 1 common of $148 billion, up from the prior quarter. We've put a Basel III capital walk here on the page in the blue call out box, which steps you through each component of the change quarter-on-quarter. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio before the impact of final US rules increased to 9.1% from 8.9%, even after the 20 basis points impact from the change in AOCI. This impact was offset by a $40 billion reduction in risk -weighted assets, reflecting impact of portfolio run-off as well as lower levels of risk. So then adding in the benefit of final rules, which was principally related to changes in MSR rules and securitization benefits, our ratio at the quarter end was estimated at 9.3%. And as you know, although we reflect our best understanding of all the rules in our ratio, we don't pull forward the impact of passive run-off or model enhancements, some of which we saw this quarter. Together, these will deliver approximately an additional 75 basis points of benefits by the end of 2014; and we remain committed to reaching a 9.5% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by year-end. Briefly on liquidity. In addition to building our capital, we accelerated compliance with the proposed Basel III liquidity coverage rules. And not only did we become compliant with the rule during the quarter, but at quarter end, our estimated ratio was 118%, and we feel great about the progress we've made. Although there can be short-term volatility in the number, you should expect that we will run around this level going forward. And to finish on page 3 in the bullets, the Board increased the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share from the previous $0.30; and during the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of common equity. As a reminder, that's $1.2 billion of the $6 billion CCAR authorization. So turning to page 4, we've added this page to help walk you through our current thoughts on the new proposals regarding Basel III leverage. Let me start with two things. We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate complement to a Tier 1 common ratio if properly calibrated, and our Holding Company leverage ratio is estimated at 4.7% at the end of the quarter, based upon the US proposed rules. And to be clear, these rules do not reflect the most recent Basel proposal which would further increase our leverage balance sheet. Just a few comments on the proposal in the US. The denominated build on GAAP assets with add-ons for derivative potential future exposures and off-balance sheet commitments, resulting in a gross up for us of approximately $1 billion. And remember, included on our balance sheet is over $450 billion of cash and other high quality liquid assets, which we think there's a strong argument that they should not attract capital at these levels. So I'm going to take you through the analysis on the page. We started with analysts' estimates for net income, and we held our dividend flat and assumed repurchases generally consistent with our current levels. Given those assumptions, we would be able to add approximately 60 basis points to the leverage ratio by the end of 2014. Additionally, we will continue to recalibrate our Tier 1 capital through the issuance of preferreds. And finally, we will take appropriate actions to reduce our leverage assets, which may include some of the points on the slide, for example, repricing or restructuring of commitments or unwinding certain derivative positions. And if you take those together, this could add another approximately 100 basis points over time, for a total of up to 160 basis points. So we will adjust our business, but we do expect the Holding Company to be able to be compliant in early 2015, with the bank to follow. Of course, a caution that the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules which are not yet final. Changing gears, let's turn to the business performance, starting on page 5 with Consumer and Community Banking. The combined Consumer businesses generated $3.1 billion of net income for the quarter on $12 billion of revenue, with an ROE of 27%. Just a quick look at the franchise. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs, and we now have nearly 1,700 Chase Private Client locations. We continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers for the Consumer businesses. Deposits were up over $40 billion year-on-year, an increase of 10%, customer attrition levels remain historically low, and our active mobile customer base grew by 32% year-on-year. So we're adding customers, we're retaining them through superior customer experience, and we're deepening our relationships with them. Also, Mortgage and Auto originations showed strong growth, up 12% and 17% year-on-year respectively; and we have record Credit Card sales volumes of $105 billion, up 10% year-on-year, and record client investment assets of $172 billion, up 16%. Turning to page 6, Consumer and Business Banking. Net income of close to $700 million and an ROE of 25% on net revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter. While we continue to see pressure on deposit margins, five basis points down in the quarter, this continues to be largely offset by very strong growth. And on the non-interest revenue side, we're seeing strong growth in both debit and investment revenue. Expenses are up year-on-year, reflecting the investments we're making in the business, including branch builds, as well as the absence of some one-time items that benefited the prior year. During the quarter, we had record Investment sales of $9.5 billion, up 53% year-on-year. And a note that approximately 70% of those sales are managed money, driving strong recurring revenue for the business up 13% year-on-year. Average business banking loan balances are flat quarter-on-quarter, up 4% versus last year; and you can see here in the drivers that the loan production stabilized just above the very low levels we saw in the first quarter. We believe that we are maintaining share despite increased competition; and the pipeline is up relative to the first quarter, which should support origination levels in the second half of the year. Turning to page 7 and Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $1.1 billion, with an ROE of 23%. At the top of the table, looking at the first blue highlighted line, reduction in pretax income was $582 million. Top line production revenue, excluding repurchases, was up slightly quarter-on-quarter, with a higher reported gain on sale pretax margin of 116 basis points more than offsetting lower closed loan volumes, down 7%. $49 billion of mortgage production saw a change in mix this quarter, as the purchase market continued to recover. Our purchase volumes increased over 40% quarter-on-quarter and contributed 36% to volumes, up from 23% last quarter. And despite the strong start in April, the environment in late May and June drove mortgage rates up significantly, around 100 basis points. This pressure has continued into July and we expect it could have a significant impact on the refinance market side in the second half of the year. So if mortgage rates stay at or above current levels, the market could be reduced by an estimated 30% to 40%. Although we will adjust capacity, expense reductions will lag volume reductions and will challenge profitability and production. Moving down to Servicing, pretax income of $133 million, up quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, on lower expenses and modest gain in the MSR. Servicing expenses of $715 million decreased quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to see Servicing, or expect Servicing costs, to decrease to $600 million by the fourth quarter. At the bottom of the table, Real Estate portfolio pretax was $1.2 billion. Run-off of the legacy portfolio continued; although in the quarter, given the positive economics of retaining certain loans, we added close to $5 billion of mortgage loans to our portfolio, which is up $1.3 billion quarter-on-quarter, and we expect to be able to sustain these levels in the second half. On Credit, delinquencies and foreclosure in our portfolio are each down around 10% quarter-on-quarter. Net charge-offs continue to come down, less than $300 million this quarter, which was in line with our guidance, and we released $950 million of reserves. The majority of this release related to the impact of lower severities, reflecting real and sustainable HTI improvement. Going forward, we expect quarterly net charge-offs of less than $250 million; and as credit trends continue to improve, expect additional reserve releases in the next several quarters. Turning to Card Merchant Services and Auto on page 8. Net income of $1.2 billion, up 21% year-on-year, with an ROE of 32%, or 23% if you exclude reserve releases, reflecting excellent underlying performance in the business. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year, and despite strong volumes, down slightly quarter-on-quarter as a result of spread compression. In Card, year-on-year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was strong and consistent, at 10% and 15% respectively. And importantly, we saw a stabilization of outstandings at the end of the second quarter after 15 quarters of net run-off. And we believe we've reached an inflection point and expect some modest growth from here. Expenses are down year-on-year, primarily driven by lower remediation expenses on our legacy product. And the net charge-off rate continues to be very low and we released $550 million of credit card loan loss reserves this quarter. This reflected both the continued improvement in early stage roll rates, as well as higher than expected levels of pay downs on modified loans. The net charge-off rate was 3.31%, down over 100 basis points year-on-year. And if we continue to see favorable roll rates, as well as our modified loans continuing to pay down, we will see incremental reserve releases in the second half of 2013. And before we move on, a few words on Auto. Originations up 17% year-on-year, reflecting market share gains and driving loan balances up 5%. Moving on to slides 9 and 10 and the Corporate Investment Bank. A strong second quarter performance, which included a DDA gain of $355 million. This was versus a gain in the same quarter of last year of $755 million, both of which are shown in the credit adjustments line. As usual, we'll focus on the numbers excluding DDA. $2.6 billion of net income was the highest second quarter net income since 2009, up 37% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter. Revenue of $9.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year, and the business delivered an ROE of 19%. Total banking revenue was $3.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year, on higher IDCs of $1.7 billion, up 38%, primarily driven by strong debt and equity underwriting. We continue to be Bank Number 1 year-to-date in IDCs; and despite weaker credit markets towards the end of the quarter, we have near record debt underwriting fees in the first half of 2013. And equity capital markets, we have the Number 1 wallet share for the first half of the year. Moving on to Markets revenue, which was up 18% year-on-year in line with our guidance, a very strong performance, particularly given the challenging environment in June, reflecting strong client flows throughout the quarter, the diversification of the business and trading risk discipline. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $4.1 billion was up 17% year-on-year, with credit and spread-related products benefiting from less Euro zone uncertainty and a stronger US housing market. Equity Markets of $1.3 billion was up 24% year-on-year, with strong client flows in cash and equity derivatives. And before we leave Markets, just a quick update on OTC clearing. The implementation of Phase II in June went very smoothly, although volumes were relatively light at launch, we have seen activity pick up and we feel we have the right level of participation. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year, and within this number, you should note growth in custody fees is in line with asset growth, but is offset by declines in agent lending as well as lower volumes in clearance and capital management. Just a comment on credit. Trends are stable at low levels, with small net recoveries for the quarter. Loans were down 6% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower balances in trade and conduits; and expenses were up 8% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher comp on higher revenues, with a comp to revenue ratio excluding DDA of 31% for the quarter. Finally on this page, at the bottom of the driver section, you see the CIB average VAR which continued to decline to $40 million, reflecting generally lower levels of risk but also lower volatility across asset classes. A note that the increased volatility in June did, however, drive spot VAR up higher to over $50 million. Before we skip over page 10, just a comment. If you take a look at the numbers for the first half of 2013, you can see we continued to make great progress in the international space and had particular strength in Asia during this quarter. Turning to page 11. Commercial Banking saw net income of $621 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 3% quarter-on-quarter, despite the softer lending environment driven by higher average loan balances, stable spreads, and positive momentum on cross-sale and IDCs. Although end of period loans were flat this quarter, we saw very strong growth in Commercial Real Estate, up 3% and gaining share, offset by lower corporate lending. Our clients have excess cash and are keeping their utilization rate low, but we've also seen the continuation of competitive pricing and aggressive structuring. We're holding the line and choosing quality over growth; and this, of course, is reflected in our strong credit performance. But we're still adding very good clients and doing many more business with our existing clients. As we look forward, we expect continued strong growth in the Real Estate business, given our competitive position. And for C&I loans, pipelines are up from the first quarter and deal activity feels like it may be turning. We are expecting a more constructive second half, and therefore should see some growth; but the environment remains competitive. Turning to page 12 and Asset Management. An excellent quarter, and despite challenging markets in June, we saw net income of $500 million, up 28% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, with an ROE of 22%. $2.7 billion of revenue, up 15% year-on-year, reflects an increase in management fees driven by strong long-term net inflows, $25 billion this quarter, marking the 17th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows; and higher equity in Fixed Income markets, up 12% based on our business mix. We also saw higher performance fees, driven by strong fund returns, and record loan balances, up $16 billion year-on-year across products and geographies. A moment on expenses. Growth and performance in the business led to 11% year over year expense growth. But as our investments season, the business is delivering positive operating leverage, which you can see in the pretax margin which is 30%, up from 27% last year. We ended the quarter with assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 9% year-on-year, and client assets of $2.2 trillion, up 10%, despite small net outflows in June. However, the breadth of our platform should enable us to continue to gather net new assets globally looking forward, and we delivered strong relative performance in both Fixed Income and Equities. Moving on to page 13 and Corporate and Private Equity. A net loss of $552 million for the quarter. Private Equity generated net income of just over $200 million, which included over $400 million of gains, in part driven by investments that are in active sales discussions. Treasury and CIO net loss was $429 million, driven by negative NII due to continued low rates and slower reinvestment, as well as a change in portfolio mix, shifting from higher yielding securities to LCR-eligible securities and cash. The results also included net securities gains and a modest loss on (Inaudible) redemption which we guided to last quarter. Excluding the net of these two items, CIO Treasury will have generated a net loss of about $350 million, which is generally in line with our guidance; and our quarterly guidance remains unchanged. Finally, Other Corporate. A net loss of $335 million includes the $600 million of pretax expense for additional litigation reserve in the quarter. Excluding litigation, Other Corporate was around $100 million net income, in line with our guidance. And again, our guidance, which does exclude litigation and significant items, remains unchanged for Other Corporate. Turning to page 14 and net interest margin. Net interest income was down slightly and core NIM was down 23 basis points quarter-on-quarter. We acknowledge this is larger than you may have expected, but let me give you some color. Importantly, it was principally a result of actions we took to build liquidity to comply with Basel requirements more quickly, which we believe is a strong positive; and to a degree, it was also our pull forward compression we guided to over time. So we've added a table on this slide which shows our cash balances and how they progress over time, and what you can see circled is that our cash was up more than $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, with other interest-earning assets being broadly flat. This changed the relative mix and also the size of our interest-earning assets and drove core NIM down the 18 basis points we circled on the page. While the increase in cash does reflect accelerated LCR compliance, it does also reflect very strong deposit growth and slower reinvestments and a little less robust loan growth. The balance of the reduction in NIMs relates to loan yield compression, partially offset by the lower cost of debt. So going forward, all else being equal, what we expect from here is relatively stable NIM in the second half of the year and net interest income to increase modestly next quarter. So finally on slide 15, here's our outlook. I've covered these items as we went through the presentation. So in wrap up, overall a very strong quarter, returning 17% on tangible common equity with excellent underlying performance across businesses, while making significant progress on capital and liquidity ratios; and the firm overall is positioned to benefit from a higher rate environment. Thank you for joining us. Operator, you can open up the call for Q&A. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Hello, John. Good morning. So we don't disclose the bank leverage ratio. But it is lower than the Holding Company, so we would have a further way to go. As we said, we intend to be compliant at the Holding Company level by the beginning of 2015 and work on bank compliance shortly thereafter.
MARIANNE LAKE: John, obviously the rules are fairly new, and still a proposal and not final. So there's work to do before they get finalized. We're working through all of the things we'd need to do to comply. I would say we would aim to be compliant by the end of 2015, but we need to go do more detailed plans and we'll get back to you with some more specifics.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, all of those things could be considered and would be considered.
MARIANNE LAKE: So in terms of the cushion, while it's not scientific, there is a volatility in that number inherent in actually deposit flows. So we do see some things in deposit flows, particularly wholesale flows, and that could span a quarter end and drive the ratio up or down some. So it's prudent to run at a ratio above 100% and around about this level. And just in terms of acceleration, we just wanted to get there more quickly. The opportunity presented itself, so nothing more than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's a great question, John, because as you alluded to in the question, there's a large number of moving parts in terms of the forecast, including points of yield on rates, which as you know have been choppy over the last several weeks. So we base our projections on modest loan growth and on our understanding of the implied rate curves and that they could all -- they could change. Also deposit flows, as you've seen, have been very, very strong. So we accelerated our LCR compliance back to the majority of the NIM compression we were previously expecting and guiding you to forward; and consequently, we expect to be more stable, with some loan yield compression being offset by lower cost of debt.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'll just give you two data points, and then you can maybe go and have a look at them. But I think in the Q, we disclose a couple of things. The first is a bit of a sweetener which says that over 12 months, it
MARIANNE LAKE: That's right. That's the 10-year going up 100 basis points. I'm sorry. And that's not exactly what we've seen, but it's the closest thing to what we're seeing right now. And then the other thing we've disclosed is on a parallel shift of 100 basis points, so if your short rates go up 2%, that would deliver just over $2 billion over 12 months. And not to say that recurs, but it takes time to build up to that.
JAMIE DIMON: And that's interest rates only, not Mortgage volume, Investment Banking volume. That's just isolating interest rates only, assuming the Company invests the way we're planning to.
MARIANNE LAKE: Those were the numbers from the last Q, and they are not meaningfully changed right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So John, I would point you to -- and I can't remember the page, I apologize -- but we put a page in Investor Day that talked about what we thought through the cycle charge-off rates were for each of our businesses. And so what I would do is look at -- take NCI loans and a reserve balance at the end of the period of $3.3 billion, take a look at that page and figure out what a more normal sort of charge-off rate, and therefore reserve balance, would be. And that will be in large part a reduction over the course of the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a journey to get to that level throughout 2014.
JAMIE DIMON: And wholesale, we're kind of where we should be. We shouldn't expect much different. Credit Card, maybe a little bit more, but put that in the hundreds of millions.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: And on Mortgage, I think we said Investment Day, eventually it will be $1 billion to $1.5 billion, within a couple years.
JAMIE DIMON: And PCI, if we have home improvement, we may see some reduction in PCI loan loss reserves. Purchase credit (Inaudible).
MARIANNE LAKE: No, we haven't done that yet, John. But the reserve release we took at NCI was driven in large part by lower severity. So if this continues, you might see some of that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So Brennan, what we laid on the page was an illustration. And you're absolutely right. What it shows you is that we want to be able to close that gap much more quickly, and so that might very well be what happens. We just aren't coming out now with a target of achieving it over the course of the next one or two quarters, because we have other objectives, including the continuation of being able to have some capital distributions to you guys that we want to be able to decide when we do CCAR at the end of the year.
JAMIE DIMON: We'll be able to do it pretty quickly when we know what it actually is. We don't want to start making actions that affect customers way in advance of knowing the real final rules.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: But what you took away from the page was absolutely right. Closing that gap should not be difficult and could be more quick than this, but we wanted to be cautious.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So we're not going to disclose the duration, but there was some changes in the portfolio as we moved out of non-eligible into eligible securities for LCR and also maintained more cash. So there were some changes. We also, as you saw, are making gains on sale and we were doing that.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
MARIANNE LAKE: No.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, when rates go up, certain mortgages lengthen and a whole bunch of different things take place. But in general, the portfolio is several year duration, a couple years duration, AA-plus; and obviously, it changes over time to manage into short exposures.
MARIANNE LAKE: That's not a bad assumption.
JAMIE DIMON: All things being equal.
MARIANNE LAKE: All things being equal, yes. (Laughter).
JAMIE DIMON: The Board -- we're not going to tell you what Board deliberations are. But the Board obviously has talked to shareholders, a bunch of ideas. And also, we think we have some of the best corporate governance out there, including -- which I think is more important than the separation of Chairman and CEO -- that the Board should make the decision based on the circumstance of the time. They know the Company, the strategy, the people, that the Board always meets without the CEO, the Board in total sets the agenda, the Board is completely engaged in CEO compensation, the Board can hire and fire the CEO at will. And those practices, some are in our charters, some are not. But hopefully, it won't be the distraction it was last year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: Hello, Betsy.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Betsy, there's nothing underlying it. Let me just give you, hopefully, enough. It is a little bit lower than $4.7 million. And given that the ratio for the Bank Holding Company is 6%, then the gap is a little bit bigger. But measured in small terms of basis points, not more.
JAMIE DIMON: And a lot of it's historical, how JPMorgan Chase got built through mergers over time, what ended up in the bank, what ended up in broker dealers. And we'll have to change our legal entities a little bit overseas. So we'll have to modify our legal entities to accomplish our the objectives, and we'll be able to do that over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: And over time, if we're able to push out, it will help.
JAMIE DIMON: Exactly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, of course.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're not going to disclose it today, Betsy, and we can reconsider that, because we think there is some pretty fundamental issues with some of those proposals, not least of which is the absence of FIN-41 netting or netting on match securities financing, which we believe and are hopeful is going to be resolved. But it is a add-on and it's not insignificant.
JAMIE DIMON: And the thing that I stress in derivative receivables but not taking benefit for collateral, which we know we get. And there are a lot of issues in there that need to be looked at and analyzed.
MARIANNE LAKE: Betsy, to Brennan's earlier question, I think in the context of what we've laid out as illustratively being achievable, then timelines would solve the problem.
JAMIE DIMON: The other important point is one of the things that Basel and all this stuff is supposed to do is harmonize global rules. This is clearly no longer harmonization, where we have one part of the world is talking about two times, with another part of the world is talking about. And I don't think there's any industry out there that would be comfortable with something like that in the long run. Because in the long run, that has a lot of effects that you can't determine, quarter-by-quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: The HPI improvement on RWA has a bit of a lag to it. So while it did contribute to the reduction in our RWA, our reduction was principally run-off, and some model enhancement and some lower risk. But in part, that lower risk was driven by better HCI.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, Betsy, it's a great question. And we will get back to you after the call.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hello, Matt.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you know, June was a bit more challenging, and so it wasn't as strong as April and May. But it really comes down to the fact that we really do have a client driven business model. And the client flows, they held up. And so if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk discipline, that's pretty much how it turned out.
JAMIE DIMON: And I think our folks in Emerging Markets also did a spectacularly good job, because I think you might see some real differentiation there from some other folks when all their numbers come out.
JAMIE DIMON: A little of everything.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we've been very consistent in how we look at comp and how we accrue it and things like that, after capital charges and by line of business, type of business and such, that it's just a change of mix and a change of capital, et cetera.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Possibly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm sorry, Mike, say that again?
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I guess that's about right. Or maybe a little less. A little less, Mike.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I think we disclose all of the assumptions in the earnings risk tables in the 10-Q. But yes, it's short rates staying low and the 10-year going up 100 basis points, I think.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but it also drags up the five-year, the seven-year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: So if you use one point, it's the 10-year. But it's the yield curve going up steeply.
MARIANNE LAKE: You're not mistaken, which is why if you actually get more of a parallel shift and short rates go up, our numbers go up by multiples.
JAMIE DIMON: The pipeline?
MARIANNE LAKE: Activity levels picked up some, and we expect that to carry into the third quarter. So a little better.
JAMIE DIMON: And you saw a real slowdown when we had the volatile markets in June, but we think that's not permanent, the markets kind of open up again. You've seen a bunch of IPOs and debt deals and a lot of M&A chatter.
MARIANNE LAKE: We didn't disclose that, Mike, for a couple of reasons. One is that, as we said, the proposals, we think, have some fundamental issues to them. But it would be lower. The gross up to our balance sheet on top of the 3.5% sitting on the page would not be insignificant, but we didn't disclose it.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, that is definitely one of the reasons. And that's one of the reasons why we said, of course, the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules, and that would be one of those changes.
JAMIE DIMON: First of all, I think it's going great. And the folks in the field will tell you that they are seeing huge benefits from putting together the corporate Global Investment Bank, the corporate Investment Bank, Treasury Services. But you are right. There's been flattening out a little bit in Treasury Services and Investor Services, which is mostly custody. Some of that's spread, some of that's margins. So some of that will benefit also a little bit from rising rates. And we don't know what the peers will show yet. So maybe you do, but I don't know yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, I don't know. And obviously, if we lag our peers, we'll be as disappointed as you are.
JAMIE DIMON: Your last one.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's balancing both, Erika, which is why, in response to the earlier question, we said we've been conservative on the timeline, because we want to reserve the flexibility to consider capital distributions when we do our CCAR in 2013, and it will be a factor we consider.
MARIANNE LAKE: So Erika, the truly truly variable, as in transaction variable proportion of the business, is some. But the majority of it is related to people and systems, so there's usually a several month lag to be able to get that out of the system.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think, think about it this way. I think that revenue margins will be down on competitive pressures, volumes are down, and expenses may go up because volumes are down, for a couple of quarters.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry, expense margins would up.
JAMIE DIMON: In other words, a dramatic reduction in profits.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant event, if rates stay where they are, if mortgage rates stay where they are, or go higher.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so let me just walk you through it. So this quarter, our expenses adjusted for litigation were $15.2 billion. For the first half, adjusted for corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters, it was $30.7 billion, which would be against the $59 billion target, which is running a little high. But there are two important factors. One is in our definition of adjustment, we only adjusted out corporate litigation, so there's other litigation in the firm that's several hundred million dollars. It's disclosed in our supplement. You can see that. And also in the first half of the year, we did see out performance in terms of the Investment Bank, or CIB, revenues. And clearly, we pay compensation on that, which is a it good expense and we would waive it in all day long. So if you take the combination of those two things that we don't technically adjust out, our underlying core expenses are on track for that number, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: You can't really think about a run rate trend in litigation costs, because they are somewhat lumpy. So we don't have a forecast for you, and they will go up and down.
JAMIE DIMON: You're absolutely right. When you separate NIM, you try to tease it out and you make our interest rates. Because you've got to look at the underlying results, underlying volumes and things like that. There's no reason to think that we aren't going to have a good trading going forward, because if the economy is strengthening, and we believe, our view is that it is, and that capital markets are going to open up again, and people get adjusted to slightly new, higher rates. And yes, volatility helps certain trading areas. Higher interest rates hurt mortgages, but again, they can help other areas. So it's a whole potpourri. It's impossible almost to separate it out. And we try to do that for you, but I think it's a little bit of a mistake when you look at the Hold Company.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we are working really hard on the CCAR resubmission. And you're right, we're going to resubmit that before the end of the third quarter. We're in constant dialogue with the regulators, although we won't receive any formal feedback until we're in the fourth quarter. And so we're doing everything we can to be able to be successful in remediating any of the issues they identify for us. And if we're able to do that, then there should be no impact.
JAMIE DIMON: It won't be for lack of trying.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it will not be for the number of people who are -JAMIE DIMON: You have probably a thousand people now who are devoted-MARIANNE LAKE: We have 500 people that are dedicated and thousands of people working on it.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just a point of clarification, if it wasn't clear, is that our guidance is that we're expecting to get our expenses down to $600 million in the fourth quarter from the level they're at now, which is $715 million for this quarter. So just to be very clear. And to remind you, our longer term run rate for that business is $325 million a quarter. So it is dominated by the default side, but there is some core performance obviously in there, too.
JAMIE DIMON: And to keep it really simple, we hope to get it to a run rate of $500 million the year after that, $400 million the year after that, and $325 million the year after, where we should be. And we have a lot of work to do in systems, et cetera to get all that done. And obviously the costly foreclosure, the legal stuff, is also coming down.
JAMIE DIMON: Three-year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Three years. And know that we're actively working the portfolio to be able to do what we can more quickly, so you would expect that we're looking at either sales or sub servicing of defaulted loans and capacatizing our performing servicing. So we're working on all of that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sure. They're all calculated the same way, based upon the disclosed closed loan volumes that we have to use. So if you take the revenues and expenses and use the closed loans volumes for the quarter, that's how we derive the margins, which is why you see some short-term noise quarter over quarter and the increase this quarter to actually 116 basis points, because we actually book revenues when we lock loans, but we report them closed.
JAMIE DIMON: Which is different than you guys do it at Wells.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would tell you that it's more of what we're seeing and feeling in discussions and activity with our clients, that we feel like deal activity levels have picked up and may be turning. And the pipeline feels a little better and solid, but not strong. So we're expecting that to translate into the second half. And obviously, as the economy continues to recover and confidence continues to grow, hopefully that will get even better.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I mean, listen, my comment on that is that Glass Steagall didn't have anything to do with the crisis, and our business model allowed us to be a port in the storm. Our customers like doing business with us
MARIANNE LAKE: We don't spend time thinking about that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So Gerard, just to be really clear, and you look at the title there, to be illustrative, we just, for the purposes of this analysis, we just hold everything flat. That's not to imply anything about what our capital distributions will be going forward, but rather to imply we can continue to do some.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, I mean it's just optimizing our mix between common and preferreds.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's too early for us to talk about passes on that level.
JAMIE DIMON: I think, folks, this just came out. So we're trying to share information with you. And it might, but give us a little bit of time and we'll give you a deeper feel how it might affect -- how this might affect different businesses, different products. Because obviously when you do something like this, this will be pushed down, at one point, not just to the line of business, but to the client and the product and the country, and then we can answer that question for you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Nothing in particular, just demand. And I should temper that with, just demand and the continuation that we've talked about of very, very strong competition. And we are, as I said, we are prioritizing quality over growth. We would tactically under perform rather than chase a deal that we weren't comfortable with.
MARIANNE LAKE: The results are in our second quarter results.
JAMIE DIMON: Not that material.
JAMIE DIMON: You should probably ask them.
MARIANNE LAKE: We hope so.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not going to give you monthly specific. I think our folks did a very good job in June.
JAMIE DIMON: Obviously, when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more of this than others. I already mentioned that Emerging Markets replies to the most volatility, both in terms of spreads volatility and equity markets, did a very good job.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you should think about mortgage as having some more releases, because we continue to see delinquencies and severities improve, particularly HPI improvement. And so you should expect that to continue, maybe not at the level that we saw this quarter, because we had a big revision to HPI, as you know, during the last several months. And in part, we've had $1.050 billion of reserve releases in the first half. Given what we're seeing, we expect more releases in the second half, but not at that level.
JAMIE DIMON: Think of the several hundred million.
MARIANNE LAKE: Several hundred million dollars.
JAMIE DIMON: It's near the end, the car. And wholesale is kind of where it should be and will bounce around.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hello, Guy.
JAMIE DIMON: You got it exactly right. At Investor Day, we gave you something that was far more dramatic than 100 basis points, and we already said the duration of this thing is not 10 years, it's a lot less than 10 years. So obviously, the effect will be less.
JAMIE DIMON: Not really.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not really.
MARIANNE LAKE: So the Investor Day scenario was a more severe scenario than the 230 basis points you're implying.
JAMIE DIMON: What was the number we gave at Investor Day?
MARIANNE LAKE: It was 300 basis, plus or minus. And this is in line with our expectations.
JAMIE DIMON: Unfortunately, OCI is not, I hate to say, is not that big a deal. We all know about it. We're all prepared for it. Rates can go up. OCI gains are going to go down. 20 basis points, you're going to see this happen elsewhere. It's asynchronous. We have OCI going through capital and the benefits going through earnings in the future. So if it were up to us, we wouldn't have actually had this asynchronous accounting to this thing. And we're prepared, we're going to have buffers that could compare that. We know how a conservation buffer works, but it's not that big a deal. The duration of our portfolio, and you guys can do it yourself, AA-plus, couple your duration, you could almost calculate the number yourself. With one caveat is that the losses are less as rates go up, because of the complexity of the portfolio, currently. And the other thing about this, we can change it overnight at any time.
JAMIE DIMON: If you move a trade to a central clearinghouse, it has no charge here and it has nothing to do with the margin that they put up with the clearinghouse. The trade is bilateral with us. You have the receivable get stressed, and you can't take the benefit of the fact that you're going to get collateral against it. That's the way the calculations are done. So any trade you move to a clearing house eliminates that exposure.
JAMIE DIMON: We've already added in our forecast to you guys some moving derivatives, on liquid cap and all that. I do think at the margins this will support things in the clearing houses. But we don't have analysis to tell you about that right now. Will it be material? We don't really know yet. Remember, the clients, there's a lot of client business who, they are also going to determine what they want. It won't be just up to us.
MARIANNE LAKE: And remember that the derivative add-on calculation is a calculation that is currently being rethought by the Basel committee because of some of the issues with it. So it could also, in and of itself, improve.
MARIANNE LAKE: We haven't done that analysis.
JAMIE DIMON: It's hard to tell.
MARIANNE LAKE: To be honest, we were trying to be very transparent and give you some ideas about the sorts of things that we're considering. We haven't translated these into detailed plans yet, so we don't know the second order impacts of this yet.
JAMIE DIMON: I think Marianne gave numbers to show that we can handle this. But also, you have to be very cognizant of client effects. We have a client business, and we have to make sure that we continue to have a client franchise. And so over time, we'll adjust the businesses, and we'll meet LCR, we'll meet Basel III, we're going to meet whatever the leverage ratio is. And think of it in some ways of alternative minimum taxes. So if every client will be running what's your return on Basel III capital and then what's your return on leverage capital?
MARIANNE LAKE: Stress capital.
JAMIE DIMON: And stress capital. So you'll try to manage all those as fair to the client and fair to the Company.
JAMIE DIMON: Obviously, we can do stuff like that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Give us a little time. We're showing you that we can get to the consolidated pretty easily, maybe have to restructure some things and change the capital structure a little bit, and move businesses out of the FDIC-insured bank and all that. I just don't think any of that's going to be critical to the future function of our business. We'll adjust those things to accomplish what we need to accomplish. And give us a little more time. It just happened a couple days ago.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, let me take do the first question -- second question first. If you have a world where some businesses have to hold twice as much capital as other companies, that obviously over time can create huge competitive disadvantages. I don't know of any industry in America who would want to compete globally in that basis. We have an interest in a safe and sound system, so not against the leverage ratio. But we would be, we're not for a hugely unbalanced competitive playing field. So put that aside. The regulators know that. They are trying to -- we thought part of Basel and all that is to harmonize these kind of things. And if you ask about it, what we show here, and Marianne just shows, anything which is a low RWA asset, including HQLA, revolvers, certain types of derivatives, those things obviously you'll look at a little bit differently because it's a leverage ratio asset. And we don't have to do it by business yet. We'll give you more detail later. Like even Marianne had mentioned that we take huge deposits in from countries and from money funds, et cetera, that you may not take in, because you can't afford capital against a deposit of $1 billion dollars you get from a money fund that you park with the Fed for 25 basis points, you pay the FDIC 10 basis points, you pay the client 5 or 6 or 7 basis points, you got to put 6% capital against it. You simply stop doing -- there are a whole bunch of things we've got to figure out how we're going to do it. But we want to make sure we manage the client franchise properly. We'll figure out the other stuff over time.
JAMIE DIMON: So separate the type of deposit, okay? So if it's a consumer deposit, it has a completely different LCR, how you can invest, the kind of spread you can make. If it's what we call big wholesale short-term deposits, you're absolutely correct. We would probably restrict some of that over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. This back up, although sharp, is not entirely unexpected. So as we talk about our longer term plans, and when we outlined all of that and the strategy for the mortgage business at Investor Day, that medium to long-term plan does not change. So it may accelerate some of the activities that we have and have, as we said, some impact on the next couple of quarters' results. But the long-term strategy hasn't changed. We're working the portfolio, optimizing servicing, trying to take costs out as quickly as possible and grow share. And actually, we think we should be able to grow share even more strongly in a more difficult market.
MARIANNE LAKE: No. No, Nancy.
JAMIE DIMON: Not yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not yet. And as you know, traditionally that would, in any case, lag. Of course, that doesn't mean it will, but that's traditionally what happens.
JAMIE DIMON: This is what the issue is with all this, you spend all your time talking about accounting, as opposed to business. The business is deposits, serving clients, doing things. And now we talk all the time about AOCI. And we have a lot of asynchronous accounting, and pro cyclical accounting and stuff like that, that we try to explain. But we try to look through all of that and build a business, more clients, more bankers, more branches, happier clients. So in all of our business, that's how we look at it. We'll work through the asynchronous accounting. If the loan loss reserve accounting changes, it would add, obviously the loan losses, though probably not as much as people think. But we still would run the business for economics in the long run. It wouldn't change how we run the business. We would be just be holding more reserves, which would be fine with us.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, as you know, the industry commented, we commented in terms of the proposal. And we are generally in favor of it, but I think that a lifetime timeline is too long, so something shorter than that would make sense. I think we need to work that through. It would be implemented over, not the course of the next couple of quarters, but in a year or so. So we'll wait and see.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say, so first of all, the industry groups haven't fully reforecast the market, so we'll wait and see what they come out with. We're trying to be transparent with our guidance, so that level, hopefully we're wrong and hopefully it will be better than that. I will say, for our own business, we didn't expect volumes to be down this much throughout the year, had this not happened with this space.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, mostly this is refi.
JAMIE DIMON: So purchase, we actually saw go up a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: They're not going to make up for refi. But they may go up, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, we're in favor of finishing. We've always believed in high capital, high liquidity, good regulation and things like that, and finishing it. And obviously, there are things that all countries have points of view about which would be different. But I think the better you get to real harmonization -- the closer you get to real harmonization, the better. If you want to start all over again, we'll spend another five years debating every single thing out there.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Well, as I said, we're expecting NIMs to stay broadly flat from here. We do expect some modest loan growth, that's our outlook. I'm not going to tell you how much, but some. And then we also have the improving cost of debt, lower cost of debt on actions that we've been taking throughout the first half.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. But we also have the yield compression. So you know, there's puts and takes. And so relatively flat on NIM, modestly up on NII.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're growing loans in Asset Management. We're growing loans in Auto. We're adding more mortgage loans. We're expecting some growth in Commercial. Our Commercial Real Estate is already growing strongly. We're expecting some growth in middle market and Corporate Client Banking space. Although we've seen loan reduction in CIB, we're expecting that to remain relatively flat. So all other things being equal, that's net growth. And Card, as I said, have hit that inflection point, so that will stop contributing to run-off, net.
MARIANNE LAKE: So our annual guidance was that, if you look at the first half of the year, you'll see that obviously already we're down year-to-date by more than that amount. So this is relative to the third quarter, we expect NII to go up. We're already down a little more than 1%.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, thank you for bragging on our trading results. And for years, the Investment Bank is building FX rates, securitized products, commodities, emerging markets, credit. And they're good. And obviously, some go up and some go down. I wouldn't say it was-- at least, I didn't see any regional effects. We trade around the world and the books get handed off around the world, so it's hard to give it a region. But we build a lot of clients low businesses and that what's driving it. I think it's better for the world to have harmonized rules around what Basel is trying to do, et cetera. But you're absolutely correct. It doesn't have to be exactly the same to have a competitive marketplace, et cetera. We always ran with higher capital liquidity than most of our competitors. I just think if one is 3% and one is 6%, that becomes just too big, and over time it could have huge competitive effects. And the regulators are working it out. We all want a fair, safe, sound financial system, okay? So that's in everyone's benefit, and there are huge capital issues -- capital requirements, liquidity requirements, leverage requirements, stress testing requirements. And among all of that, I feel that we're getting there. But at one point, this should be somewhat harmonized. And your middle two questions, I now forgot.
MARIANNE LAKE: Can we get back to you on some of that stuff? We're sort of running out of time rapidly.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, correct.
JAMIE DIMON: Estimated to the best of our ability.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, David, we did say at the beginning that we do think that having a leverage ratio is an important part of our capital management toolkit or process, as long as it's properly calibrated. And so for us the two questions, I think they are very important and the industry does, too. So we're participating in discussions. As Jamie's talked about, what should the quotient, or the ratio, be and making sure that that not only is appropriate but fair across the globe, and also what should the calculation for the denominator be. And we've alluded already to two specific questions, but there are more. One is should high quality liquid assets, most particularly cash and cash at central banks, be treated the same as other balance sheet items? And then in terms of some of the additional add-ons that are being proposed, we think they could have issues, actual issues, for the operation of the financing market. So I think there's going to be a lot of work that takes place. There are comments due back on all of those proposals by mid-September, call it, plus or minus. And I think this will be worked through through the fourth quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",0.15000000000000013,0.0750000000000007,1,0.08176224073659419,0.11643360020167261
39,Q2_2010,"
MIKE CAVANAGH, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks, Jamie. I just want to say thanks to the entire finance team at JPMorgan Chase. They've done great for me and they're going to do a great job for Doug, and welcome, Doug, and congrats from me, as well. I'm going to start and go through the usual slide deck that we've got here, so if you start on page one here, second quarter highlights. As you've seen, we earned $4.8 billion after tax, earnings per share of $1.09 on revenues of about $26 billion in the quarter. We flagged for you the two big significant items and most of the rest of the stuff we'll get into washes itself out throughout the rest of the numbers. But two big items, reduction to loan loss allowance of about $1.5 billion, or $0.36 after tax. I'll cover this up front once. It's really coming in three places throughout the firm. First is in the Investment Bank where we had about $350 million pretax reserve release. That's really the same reason as last quarter. Loan paydowns and loan sales, freeing up reserves. In the Credit Card business then, you'll see the lower current losses leading to lower estimates for future losses and that leads to a reduction in reserves of about $1.5 billion there. And then finally, in our Commercial Bank, about $400 million pretax of reserve release, which is just related to the periodic but normal refinements to our credit loss estimates in that business. So those three places are what's driving the reduction to loan loss allowance. We still end the quarter with $37 billion of loan loss reserves and more than 5% loan loss coverage. So feel very good, in very good shape on that score. The other items, the UK bonus tax, we booked about $550 million after tax, mostly running through the comp line, all running through the compensation line, mostly in our Investment Bank. So those two items together, about $0.22 worth of net positive earnings, so about $0.87 away from that. Broad characterization of those results is that most of our businesses performed pretty solidly as you'll see when we go through the numbers. And of particular note is the decline in levels of actual charge-off losses in our consumer businesses, both Retail and Credit Card from prior quarters. Capital strength continued to be very strong, strong balance sheet continues and we'll get to that towards the end. So now flipping on slide two, I'm just going to skip, it's everything I just said, and now let's go to the Investment Bank on slide three. So there you see circled number, profits of $1.4 billion in the Investment Bank. I've already commented on the credit cost line, which was driven by the reserve release. So starting with revenues, you see total revenues of $6.3 billion in the quarter for the Investment Bank. So starting with Investment Banking fees, as you can see and read for yourself, we continue to be number one ranked year-to-date in Investment Banking fee revenue. And that amounts to $1.4 billion for the quarter, which is down from a very strong and capital issuance heavy quarter in the prior year. Moving to the markets businesses, I'd say generally speaking, that we are back to sort of pre-crisis levels for spreads, and that combined with lower levels of client activity as a general matter throughout the quarter on average is the broad backdrop. But specifically Fixed Income Markets, you see we had revenues of $3.6 billion, down from last quarter and last year and that's the main areas for those declines from prior periods, was in credit markets businesses, rates and commodities areas. Included in the fixed income revenues of $3.6 billion, is about $400 million positive of benefit from DVA, or credit spread tightening on structured notes. Next, in Equity Markets, $1 billion of revenue, and that included $200 million of DVA, not much more to really highlight there, nor in credit portfolio revenues. Just on expenses, $4.5 billion, remember that includes the UK bonus tax. When you back that out, the comp to revenue ratio in the quarter was about 37%. So that's it for the Investment Bank. Moving on now to Retail, page four gives you what drives the P&L that we're going to see on the next slide. I'll just say Retail Banking, top portion of the page, deposit taking business, Retail branches, you can read these for yourself but you continue to see healthy underlying trends in the growth of the business, whether it's stabilization and growth in deposits, remember, we've been running off high cost deposits so the net growth here we feel good about and continued growth in other underlying trends. Middle of the page, other consumer lending and mortgage banking originations, total of about $38 billion worth of loan originations in the quarter. That's part of $156 billion of loan originations across the whole business, including middle markets, small business, in the broader Company. So we continue to be originating credit for our clients at very good levels. And I'll talk about real estate portfolios at the bottom in a second. If you flip to slide five, you have the P&L for the Retail business. I'll walk you down the circled numbers on the left. So in total, Retail, the sum of all of this division made $1.042 billion of net income in the quarter. Moving down to the next circled box you see the Retail Banking side which I just commented on in the prior page earned $914 million in the quarter. I'll let you read the commentary in the press release and to the right here, it's pretty straightforward, what's going on in the business. And healthy trends there. The next piece is the ongoing production, origination of mortgage loans, and other consumer lending, including auto. And there you see we had profits circled of $364 million. Again, I'll let you read what's going on there, and just point out that the $2 billion of revenues in that space continues to have a drag on it of loan repurchase expense and reserving that's counter revenue there. That's a little higher than it was last quarter, flattish to where we were in the fourth quarter of last year, but continues to be in our level of expectations, but obviously continued uncertainty as to how that continues to progress. And then finally at the bottom, you have the real estate portfolio balances. Obviously this is driven heavily by our actual credit cost and prior period reserving. No reserving at all this quarter to the positive or the negative. Just lower credit costs that I'll cover. Let's go to that. That was a loss in aggregate of $236 million. If you flip the slide to slide six, you pick up the circled numbers on the left and the commentary then in the upper right is that you see the decline, substantial decline in the second quarter versus last quarter and a year ago, in actual current quarter charge-offs and that's on the back of the improved delinquency, early bucket delinquencies that we've been commenting on for the past several quarters continuing to roll through, as well as moderating levels of losses where we do have defaults. So lesser levels of, or moderating levels of loss severity. What we would say is that those trends appear to be stable from beginning of quarter to end of quarter. So it's not clear that we can count on continued improvement from these levels. But in terms of our outlook, at these levels of delinquency and loss severity, if we hold where we are, we would expect to see our quarterly losses run at the kind of levels that you see in the outlook box in the middle of the right-hand side. So at or below $1 billion for home equity, $400 million for prime mortgage and $400 million or so per quarter for subprime mortgage. That's obviously a change from the outlook we'd previously given which you could think of -- we used to guide towards where we could see losses progressing upwards in prior quarters, as we talked about this guidance, now we're sort of giving you more of an outlook based upon a static level of delinquencies and loss severities running at these kind of numbers from here. So clearly an improved underlying loss picture here. But still cautious and still, again, no changes in our reserve levels in that business. Moving on to Card Services on slide seven. So here you see we had profits circled on the left, profits of $343 million. Credit costs being the big story. So I've already mentioned the $1.5 billion pretax reduction in loan loss reserves. So let's just focus on the actual charge-offs in the quarter. Which you see circled number on the left, again, the 9.02% charge-off rate in the quarter for the Chase portfolios, this is ex-WaMu, an improvement from last quarter, you see the printed number last quarter was 10.54%. But recall, that was inflated due to a payment holiday that I won't go into. But on a real basis, we dropped about 90 basis points in losses quarter-over-quarter. And as you'll see, where we get to the outlook, we could see that improving again by maybe another 50 basis points to 8.5% charge-off rate plus or minus for the Chase portfolios as we look into next quarter would be our best guess, given the level of trends we're seeing. On the revenue side, $4.2 billion of revenue. That's down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And very similar trends to what we -- dynamics that we have talked about in the past. So you've got lower outstandings on lower sales, higher level of -- the level of charge-offs we've experienced, less balance transfer activity as well as us running off the Washington Mutual portfolio and now we're starting to get some impact of the Card Act legislation, which is probably about 25% of it in our run rate in this quarter on the revenue side. The next three businesses, Commercial Bank, TSS and Asset Management, I'll cover pretty quickly. They are, the dynamics of this business is very similar to what they've been in the past, so I'll just flip through these very quickly but hit a few items. On the Commercial Bank it's $693 million, that includes the $400 million reserve release, ex that, that's $450 million or so after tax. That's based upon the $1.5 billion level of revenues you see here, which continues to be strong. The dynamic I guess I'd point out, if you look at the key statistics, you see end of period loans and leases, the circled number $96 billion of loans and leases, flattish to where we were last quarter. And down from a year ago. So we continue to see maybe some signs of activity on the horizon but not yet translating into actual increase in loan demand and continued low level of utilization in the low 30%, 30, 32% utilization rates against the committed lines we have to our clients in this space. Next business, Treasury and Security Services, profits of $292 million in the quarter. Again, general environment of low rates putting pressure on revenues here, but in the second quarter, we actually get a seasonal benefit embedded in it and you can see it in the Security Services side from securities lending, particularly coming out of Europe in the second quarter of the year. Finally, on the business side, Asset Management on slide 10, $391 million of net income, strong assets under management and revenues related to that on continued strong investment performance which you can read on the right-hand side. The one thing I'd point out as you can see from the commentary on flows in the middle of the right-hand side, that we're seeing outflows in sort of low spread, low risk, low return liquidity products, $29 billion, and $126 billion for the last quarter and last year, and that's partially offset on the flow side with flows back into longer term bond and equity type of funds. Slide 11, Corporate and Private Equity, you see Private Equity is very modest, modest activity in the quarter, $75 million of revenues, translating into $11 million of after-tax profits. So the big item being the Corporate segment itself. You see $642 million of profits in the quarter. I'll just jump to where I think that's going. That, for a host of reasons, think of that as a number that in future quarters, coming quarters could trend towards $300 million plus or minus but obviously there's lumpy items that occur any one quarter to the next. So in this particular quarter, we had a level of securities gains coming out of our investment portfolio of about $900 million, and then on the expense side, we had some higher litigation expenses booked in the quarter. So those numbers are washing through, together with just the over the quarter a higher level than normal of -- than what we'll see on an ongoing basis of portfolio size throwing off net interest income. So moving to capital on slide 12, you see Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 Common capital grew in the quarter, $131 billion to $137 billion, and $104 billion to $108 billion, helping drive with flattish risk weighted assets and total assets a little bit of a decline. You see Tier 1 capital ratios and Tier 1 Common very, very, very strong at 12.1% and 9.6%. I already commented on the very strong level of credit reserves and I will just point out that at the tail end of last quarter, carrying through to yesterday we bought back about $500 million worth of stock in the past several weeks. So finally, on the quarter outlook, looking ahead, on page 13, I think I covered well everything related to the Home Lending guidance on the left-hand side, so I'll skip that. I will just give you an update in terms of where we are on the overdraft fees in Retail. You see that we are just updating our estimates there of the net income impact. Previously on an after-tax basis, $500 million, plus or minus. Now, a little bit higher, $700 million, plus or minus, is our best current estimate of what the full impact when it ramps in will be. Only about half of that is currently running through our numbers. On the Credit Card side, I commented on the declining balances for a host of reasons, and you can see and read for yourself that we expect that to continue for the same reasons that we're currently seeing, including the runoff of the WaMu portfolio, and some legacy low yield balances in our outstandings. Credit losses, already commented on the 8.5% plus or minus charge-off rate for Chase and then on the Card Act side, the total impact that we're expecting to see would be about $750 million, plus or minus. Now that now includes our view of what the final piece of legislation, which was around what defines reasonable and proportionate fees, is a new item, but I think all in we're at $750 million, plus or minus. We used to be at $500 million to $750 million without that item, but now with that in, think about us as being at $750 million plus or minus and I already commented on the level of expected profits in Corporate. So I guess the final thing I'll comment on is regulatory reform on slide 14. We're not going to say too much about this today, other than these comments, given that we're getting the vote today and there's still even past today's voting a lot to be defined by regulators and many uncertainties that makes it difficult to talk about this with precision, but let me just run through what's on this page, which is that we do recognize, and we've talked a lot about the many positive aspects that are going to be coming as part of the pending regulation. We're happy to see, and always run ourselves this way, higher capital and liquidity requirements across the financial sector is a good thing. Resolution authority, we lived through Bear Stearns and ourselves saw the problems of not having power to resolve institutions more broadly than just the traditional powers over Commercial Banks, so we welcome that. And we think it's a very good idea to have system-wide risk oversight so there's clearly some pluses that we look forward to benefiting from on the other side of regulation. Definitely have to point out, though, that there are some challenges that come along with where we sit which is obviously what I already said, that there's many uncertainties remain. So while we expect to get this legislation today, there remain hundreds of rules to be written, and ongoing interpretations that will really define what this looks like. There's a need to get global coordination obviously, for this to be well-executed and that's still to be done. And then of course, with anything of this kind of magnitude, with the ongoing interpretations that are going to come, none of us really know what unknown consequences are going to come for our business activities and our clients. So that's on the challenges side. But would sum up that it's going to have a significant impact on many of our businesses. We're spending a lot of time thinking about this, and particularly about how it's going to affect our clients, because as you know, we're a very client-focused set of businesses so a lot of energy is going in to make sure we understand clearly what it's going to mean for those clients, and going back to my first point, very hard here to with any kind of real certainty speak to you about what the impact could be here, because the first point is that this is all going to phase in over time. So it's not like the potential financial impacts are going to be here tomorrow. This will gradually affect our results to whatever degree it does. What effect it does have is clearly going to be a result of how clients respond in terms of what they choose to -- what services they avail themselves of and at what volume levels, so that's a little bit of guesswork at this stage, and of course whatever impacts there are going to be is going to be in part mitigated at least through adjustments to business models or pricing of products and services, and in many cases in our businesses, the benefit that our shareholders will get back by having capital released as a result of some of the changes in this legislation. So all more to come as we understand more, we'll be as clear as we can be. I'd just remind everybody that for JPMorgan Chase in particular, we've always thought about running ourselves as a client focused business, not heavily dependent on proprietary activities, which is a main thrust of the ideas behind the legislation we are not at all disturbed by. In our client businesses, for investing for our clients, we've always had a clear separation between what we do as a fiduciary for our clients and where we run risk with the firm's own capital so that's another thought in the legislation that we're very comfortable with. Clearly, you all know us as being highly focused on running a strong balance sheet with extremely strong liquidity and strong capital base, and, again, finally, there's the strength of the fundamentals of the various businesses we choose to compete in, and the diversified earnings power and margins that we get out of the businesses by running them well, is part of what allowed us to really run our way through the crisis and never have a losing quarter. That's how we think about it is from here, we're just going to continue to do what we've always done which is commit ourselves to implementing this regulation in a way that protects our clients and protects the competitiveness of the US financial system and JPMorgan Chase in doing that. And I will speak for us that we've got hundreds of work streams around this place already engaged deeply in understanding and looking to implement this legislation in a thoughtful way that I just described. So not to say we will have plenty more to discuss as time goes by in legislation once we have finer points and better details to provide, but these are our thoughts for today on that score, so with that, why don't we go to questions?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hey, Guy.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Thanks, Guy.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I would say, Guy, as we talked about before, we do worry about those thoughts but make sure that when we actually take account of our current period charge-offs and our expectations for future losses, we are trying to be very cognizant of delays in courtroom filings and backlogs in courts and so forth to make sure that we're keeping current in our losses and our forecasted losses the best we can. So we're constantly concerned and try to reflect it in what we do.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Good morning.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think, Matt, it's in part -- I've got to hold aside what goes on in the trading businesses, so holding that aside, the level of spread is down just a touch and probably comes down a touch again, so it's really the volume declines across the consumer portfolios that will put a little bit of continued downward pressure on NIM dollars looking ahead.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes, I think some of that was changes in the investment portfolio as well.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The run rate at the end of the quarter is lower as a result of the sales that generated $1 billion or so, $900 million of gains. Think of that as pulling forward some of that NIM.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's right.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's really just a refinements as we're getting further down the road of opt-in levels, is the main driver, a little bit less than we had originally forecast opting in and that's driving the number for impact a little higher.
MIKE CAVANAGH: There will be more pressure in aggregate on the results in Card because we're only about 25% of the way. I've got to come back to you on how much that will be through NIM versus other portions of revenue.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Seeing activities, again, same as last quarter, strengthen what's going on in small business lending, double the level that we originated last year. Middle market and commercial is flat. I'd say it's similar to what we said before, plenty of dialogue going on between our clients and our bankers, as folks get themselves ready to take some actions, but just not yet really manifesting itself in drawdowns on lines or loans going up just yet. Hopefully we get some of that.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes. So I mean, obviously when we talked about the revenue impact if derivatives go into exchanges in the extreme case as Jamie said, we never then really tried to quantify, just pointed out that that's a capital reducing event as well. So that's the point. And some of these activities, there will be capital freed up as the business models adjust. So that also makes it very hard to put numbers on the totalities of effect when you take into effect, timing, first blush issues of change, capital release and business model change.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, I didn't see them either, Meredith.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think that's part and parcel for the thoughts around BASEL 3 that we need more clarity on come the fall.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's between true commercial real estate and the multi-family lending, both of those running higher than that average and so middle market, commercial and industrial, excluding that would be a little bit lower than the 75ish basis points which goes back to Jamie's point about the health of Corporate America.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hi, Jim.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I mentioned it, I thought it mentioned it anyway. In fixed income we had about $400 of DVA, and in Equity Markets we had $200 million of DVA.
MIKE CAVANAGH: In those numbers it's pretty much a wash. A our credit portfolio revenue line has a whole bunch of things going on in it but not worth -- they wash themselves out. In fixed income Equity Markets, DVAs, CVAs, pretty much the numbers I just gave, 400 and 200.
MIKE CAVANAGH: But that's another place where we would love to see the accounting rules get away from that pro cyclicality before this cycle is fully over.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No. Looking at businesses there, you'll see pretty stable wholesale deposits, liability balances.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's right. That's right. Started toward the tail end and continued through yesterday.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes. But going back to what Jamie said, the pace will depend on where the price is.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think you're making two points. One is we would agree that in the businesses, particularly the consumer side, charge-offs are running still, even though they've improved at historically high levels, and versus what I showed you at Investor Day back in February. There is still room to go for charge-off levels to get back to what we would consider to be the appropriate level for the risk we're taking and the way we're building our business models. So that's fair enough. Then reserving, we spent plenty of time talking about, Ron. You get that side of it as well.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Right. We do it the other way. We look at what normal charge-offs would be with no provisioning down the road and what would that mean for total provision. You may be right. We just haven't done that calculation like that.
MIKE CAVANAGH: 15%.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Call it plus or minus 90%.
MIKE CAVANAGH: In challenges, clearly just dealing with the change and some of the remaining uncertainties we talked about, and it's hard to pick any one particular opportunity but it's just the strength of all of our businesses. They each have places where we're putting lots of resources into doing more for our clients and expanding the capabilities we have for the long-term of this place. So Jamie hit on them, some of the international stuff, products and Credit Card, you can go on and on.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Thanks. That's it. Thank you everybody.",0.3800000000000001,-0.9460000000000002,0,0.0905262298949691,0.10763218986935372
40,Q2_2011,"
JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: So you have to apply under ICAAP, whatever it's called, to regulators to increase dividends and buy back stock. We already announced we have the permission to $8 billion. It's quite obvious to us we're going to have a lot of extra capital and cash, not just in the next short run but over the next several years, and we will apply for more as appropriate. I can't tell you exactly what they're going to do.
JAMIE DIMON: You couldn't possibly be as frustrated as me, okay. But so I guess -- so you're right, it's how you calculate it. But a lot of things are going to happen, Glenn. For example, I think it will force competitors in a lot of areas to go to the higher number. So you're going to find a lot of people, they won't be able to survive at 7 in whatever business they're in because all the other competitors are going to be at 8 or 9 or something like that. But assuming your number is right, it is not a huge drag on returns, but it also gives the opportunity to cherry pick the businesses you want. So I think you will see a lot of very tight management at RWA businesses, balance sheet items, in a lot of the ways I personally think are a waste of time, but that's what will happen so that you can get good adequate returns on capital. In some ways a G-SIFI will be a plus; you'll win business that other people will have a hard time competing for. In other things it could be a negative, like for example owning consumer assets might be a negative. On the other hand, you can originate, sell, securitize, so you can still be in the generation business but not necessarily the holding the asset business. And I also think you'll see plenty of non-banks, good and bad, grow to handle and own some of these other asset classes and other forms of securitizations do the same thing. So it's a long road and I still think we'll have very good businesses when all is said and done.
JAMIE DIMON: We're paying more FDIC insurance and we're paying for all the bankrupted banks.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, so Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain is still about the net exposure, so it's net of collateral and it's non-sovereign collateral of about $15 billion. Think of those exposures at the banks, sovereign and corporates. And we're managing that exposure to -- we have a big business with those countries and we intend to be in those countries for a long time. So we're not going to cut and run. In my Chairman's letter I wrote about worst case, which I do not expect to happen even today, that it causes maybe $3 billion after tax. That's my best guess, by the way, so that can obviously be dramatically different. I still don't expect that. The real impact of failures over there would be on what does it do to the global economy, what does it do to other exposures in Europe, what does it do to exposure in the United States. And you can guess that as well as I can. I don't expect it will be a disaster for French and German banks obviously with exposures in France and Germany and elsewhere. But I think those things will probably all be fine.
JAMIE DIMON: Buyer of credit exposure on the five nations I just spoke about?
JAMIE DIMON: Here's the problem with the numbers you see because there is a public disclosure that shows those five countries like being $100 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: Right? But that $100 billion does not include collateral, it does not include hedging. And we do a lot of hedging, both specific name and country hedging. So that's the issue with that. So my $15 billion is net of hedging, net of collateral and I mean non-sovereign collateral. So we wouldn't include Greek collateral, Greek sovereign collateral for a Greek repo. We would only include collateral outside of Greece. So that's where the $15 billion comes from. That is the best estimate of the exposure, it bounces around all the time.
JAMIE DIMON: You said (multiple speakers) there was some report in the press today I saw that Greece and -- I mean Germany and France was $300 billion, same issue. Those are very gross exposures and the numbers would be 10% of that.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I'm comfortable with the $15 billion right now.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, the bulk of that is Spain and Italy and a lot of that is also corporate. And you know, corporates are -- you've got to be very careful when you talk about -- even when you had failures in Argentina and Mexico a lot of the corporates were okay. So you've got to be very careful. We've been doing business with those countries for a long period of time. So our current thinking is that we're going to continue to do business there and manage those exposures, we're not trying to drive them down.
JAMIE DIMON: And I hope -- I hope that one day some of these European nations appreciate the fact we're not cutting and running.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, you know, when you say manage the risk around that, that's a tough one to answer. The risk around -- were you talking about just a downgrade risk? I think that's manageable, but that will cause problems and issues because some people need AAA collateral, some people can't own, so it will cause issues. I don't like the downgrade issue. But a government default issue is far more severe than that. And that would cut across intraday lines, revolvers, takedown of revolvers, money market funds, securities lending, something like $3 trillion or $4 trillion of treasuries and uses collateral around the world. It would change the pricing of securities; some flyers, some owners will be forced to sell because they're not allowed to own default securities. I don't know what the rating agency would do if the United States goes in real default. If it goes in real default can they keep the United States at AA plus? I don't know. If they move it down to D, which is default, that would cause a lot of other issues and people would be forced to sell. So there's huge cross currents in that and it's not the kind of thing that I think people should play with. And what surprises me about the conversation at all isn't -- you can talk about all the potential catastrophic outcomes, but I -- no one can possibly say, in my opinion who is semi-rational, could possibly say that there's no chance of a catastrophic outcome. And therefore why would you take that risk?
JAMIE DIMON: You know, first of all it's so far out, so we're going to -- I think what we're saying now is that we originally made a statement we were going to go to the 7% right away, we're at 7.5%. We don't need to be higher than the 7.5%. And I'm not sure the regulators want people to move higher than that very quickly because they do believe that would cause a lot of banks to dramatically reduce their balance sheets. We're going to generate so much excess capital, but there's no need to be over 7.5%. So one of the things that will drive excess capital is the runoff and what I call natural mitigation. There are certain things the balance sheet will run off -- big uses of capital. Think credit hybrids, re-securitizations, mobile rated things. And then there will be other decisions we make over time of businesses we may not want to be in because they use up too much capital. And so it'll be a wide variety of things, but I think at the end of the day we'll still be looking at very good returns for our shareholders in the capital we do deploy.
JAMIE DIMON: That ratio is going to drive up so fast people are going to be surprised and not just for us, by the way. I've mentioned this before. You're going to see a lot of banks in the US, and maybe some banks around the world, start to generate huge amounts of excess capital. Everyone is at a different time table, so maybe some banks may be a quarter or two behind us but it will happen and then they won't know what to do with it. That's what's going to happen. We're going to have huge excess capital in the banking system in about 12 months, way beyond what the banking system needs. And God knows why we have to hold all that capital, but that's where we are.
JAMIE DIMON: All I'm saying is we don't see any need to go over that. We may not be able to avoid going over that, is that what you're saying?
JAMIE DIMON: And then if we have that problem we'll figure out what we can do.
JAMIE DIMON: What did Kohl's (inaudible)?
JAMIE DIMON: Which is great, I mean the sales volume is up 10% or something, it's really -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: That's right.
JAMIE DIMON: -- extraordinarily good.
JAMIE DIMON: No. We've estimated agency put backs and obviously it's changing the timing issues, but we do our best estimate. If we see a different thing we'll let you know. We've been a little conservative on that, hopefully.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so, it's $1 billion and it's very careful. We're not going to do anything that's not consumer friendly. So a lot of that quote recruitment will be -- and some of this already has a little bit of rewards programs and we're going to test various things and we already have -- you already have some checking accounts that have modest fees in it. So we're going to come up with something that will help mitigate that a little bit.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so, the reason -- you're right, it should run lower than $1.2 billion. But embedded in our thinking as the home prices go down a little bit, there's a lot of uncertainty, we still have the DOJ and the AGs. There are going to be changes in how we have to modify loans and service loans. We have foreclosure delays and all that kind of stuff, so we're just trying to be conservative here. It's not likely to be higher than $1.2 billion next quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: Doug.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, it's just an estimate, so it will be plus or minus something. But, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: We're going to look at every possibility. And there are a lot of restrictions what we can do because they blocked off like a charge card where automatic deductions at the end of the year.
JAMIE DIMON: But we're going to look at every possibility and hopefully offer our customers great products and great services, better than our -- than some of the non-bank competitors and get paid for it.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, but we're not going to tell you what we do day in and day out, but we bought $3.5 billion around these prices and we -- we've said we're going to have capital generation. So, permission to buy more.
JAMIE DIMON: So, GSE, I think we're done. The foreclosure delays and settlements, etc., we have an estimate. My guess is it could a little bit higher, but it's not -- hopefully not a huge number. MSR, more could be done, it could be a little bit but it shouldn't be a lot more. And the private-label stuff will probably go up a little bit, but I doubt it will go up more than the reserves we're going to have to take down in the next 12 months.
JAMIE DIMON: Because it's possible we're very over reserved in mortgage land too. So, but that's litigation. It's going to take -- we think it's going to go to litigation, but we don't know how you can do it the other way. So that's why we have it under litigation and we're not going to disclose exactly the numbers for that.
JAMIE DIMON: We don't look at it in NIM, okay. NIM is just -- like we have profits and we have clients. So the clients have deposits, you don't really want to turn them away if they're good clients. So even if you have to invest at a very small spread you probably would do that, right?
JAMIE DIMON: Building your business. And obviously we are constantly managing our interest rate exposure and rates going up will help us, whether -- we could change that tomorrow and increase our NIM, but then you're taking far more exposure against rising rates.
JAMIE DIMON: It's just -- you know, everything was down a little bit from last quarter, but all the businesses pretty much continue to have pretty good flow -- you know, client flow businesses. And --.
JAMIE DIMON: Mike, your guess is as good as ours on that. Of course it's possible that some of these things start to get worse and cause severe problems. And so we're very conscious of that. And how it flows back to the United States, it's hard to tell.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, no, it's a good business, but it's only -- it's less than 20% of the $1.9 billion of total investment banking fees. And the balance sheet -- remember, only some of that stays on the balance sheet. We sell all loans, we syndicate loans, we have distressed stuff that goes off the balance sheet. So the build-up -- most of the build-up I think Doug already mentioned was global core banking and the conduit business which we still think is a good business. But the syndicate business, the investment bank balance sheet, loan balance sheet stuff bounces all over the place because corporations always have the ability generally to go to the markets. So they're always deciding between bonds and loans. And even of the loans, some of that -- a lot of that stuff gets syndicated.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, Mike, we have tremendous visibility of next quarter already just by looking at delinquencies and roll rates. So you have very good visibility one quarter out and some visibility two quarters out.
JAMIE DIMON: We won't go up -- we won't be that -- we won't go up in the next quarter, put it that way.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, we're not going to give you one. But it's -- if things continue the way they are it will be pretty good.
JAMIE DIMON: Do you know the number?
JAMIE DIMON: No. So you'll see the full effect of Durbin will be fully felt in the fourth quarter; it will be about $250 million and it will be barely mitigated in the fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I would do anything to get it done today. But our counsel advises us that it could take a quite a while. There are a lot of parties engaged in this. And I gather people have gotten much closer on it, but if we get that call we'll be on an airplane, we'll be down there and we'll be signing up. One of the reasons to do that is it's good for the United States of America to get behind us all this stuff to fix it and move on. Delaying foreclosures and all the uncertainty around mortgages is not a good thing for the economy, I think you understand that. So we stand ready to do it as soon as we can.
JAMIE DIMON: It's got to be done right. We're not going to do it and be subject to double and triple jeopardy. We'd rather litigate it.
JAMIE DIMON: There are always other pluses and minuses, and you'll see some of that when the 10-K comes out because we have to disclose that now -- the 10-Q I mean.
JAMIE DIMON: I'm not sure what you mean by plan B. You know, we're not going to stop growing our business and hiring bankers and opening branches and growing checking accounts and trying to do more trading business and making Middle Market loans because you have a peculiar interest rate curve. And if it squeezes margins a little bit in some places so be it. (multiple speakers) we could change that in two minutes. So if you wanted to increase NIM we could just increase interest-rate exposure and increase NIM.
JAMIE DIMON: If they're not that different we'll still be fine, you know, we'll figure out ways to price products and services and make it a margin and we'll be fine.
JAMIE DIMON: You're making a good point. We have -- we are blessed to have One Equity Partners which is we just think an exceptional group of people. And obviously, we always say about Private Equity, those gains themselves are going to be lumpy, they're not going to -- but we're like Warren Buffett in that this one, we prefer 20% lumpy -- average but lumpy returns than 12%. And so over time this number will go up or down, but it's real earnings for the Company, it's just you can't look into your model every quarter, but it's doing this for the Company and we expect to get those 20% returns over time.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, we don't know the final rules on that yet. Remember, that stuff won't be in effect for eight years, so give us a little time on that one. But we would certainly use our capital if we thought there were things that we could do that were great for shareholders whether it's buying a company or buying assets. So if you have any brilliant ideas, give us a call.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, but we didn't have a lot of that either, did we? So I've already said it was non-sovereign collateral, so some of these things have collateral that's usually pretty good, we're very careful we take as careful. Some of the hedges are not perfect; there are some country CDS hedges that are offsetting company type of exposures and we have specific name exposures that are sometimes directly offset. And some of it's in the training book or derivative exposure would change over time. But we -- that's why we can understand the $15 billion and we're pretty conservative on it and obviously you can make money be worse off or better off than you think, but it's not going to move by $15 billion. It's going -- you're talking about being plus or minus a $1 billion here or there.
JAMIE DIMON: I think I can categorize it as that spreads have normalized, they came back to normal for a while. Obviously it changes in every business a little bit. And that flows have been good, have been good fairly much across all the products. Some months were lower than others and -- but it's really those two things.
JAMIE DIMON: I think a little bit was a flight to safety and a little bit was just people managing their own balance sheets. And there's a lot of liquidity around the world and some of it went away early in the quarter but not all of it.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I don't think in the wholesale businesses you're seeing repricing yet because I don't think a lot of these things are actually effective yet. I think you've seen some repricing in consumer business and more relating to all the other legislation, you know, the card, the overdraft and stuff like that. So -- but I don't think you've seen it exactly yet in wholesale businesses.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not even at stage one of repricing.
JAMIE DIMON: There are a lot of other changes coming too, your, margin requirements and how these things get applied globally, the liquidity requirements which I think will cause some repricing, so -- but very little yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I think you're going to see repricing in certain types of deposits and certain types of loans, certain types of revolvers, shorter duration revolvers -- I think you're going to see those things, you haven't really seen them yet.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so I guess again, the one that's going to happen is reducing the maximum size that they'll guarantee from like $750,000 to $630,000, whatever it is. We don't think that's going to have a substantial impact. I think it was 1% of the volume is done in between those levels. So the impact of that will be jumbos will go up a little bit and where you sell the agencies will go down a little bit. Most of the changes they're talking about are not in the near term, they're just talking about them to be effective years from now. And so there's plenty of time to figure out how to do that. At the end of the day we'll be in the mortgage business and I think it will return to being a good business. It will be much more conservative, much more carefully done, there will be much different servicing standards and -- but I don't think the announcement is going to change that much.
JAMIE DIMON: When you say DCM -DOUG BRAUNSTEIN: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: -- are you talking about primary issuance or are you talking about trading, secondary?
JAMIE DIMON: Oh, so we kept (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: And we were more the bigger -- more of the lead manager of the number one share.
JAMIE DIMON: Part of the DCM numbers also are syndicated loan which we were obviously pretty strong in too.
JAMIE DIMON: Yeah
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: Forever.
JAMIE DIMON: It's going to go down 10% or 15% a year until it's close to zero, that's what it's going to do.
JAMIE DIMON: You know -- listen, the world isn't doing Subprime any more, the world isn't doing -- well, so Home Equity will come down to a number then stabilize, but it's a lot lower than it is today. And jumbo is a decision that you make whether to put on balance sheet or not and I think that class of asset will be most affected by some of these G-SIFI things. So we'll see on that one.
JAMIE DIMON: We can buy or sell portfolio things anytime we want.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Well remember, the Board is the primary driver of capital decisions and so, no, the Board -- if we think it's appropriate to go to talk to the regulators again about capital, we would.
JAMIE DIMON: Right. But I think it's important to point out the Board is responsible for this Company, not just the regulators.
JAMIE DIMON: It's still America. Capitalism is still alive. If the regulators start making all capital decisions then they should be the Board.
JAMIE DIMON: It's possible, but we're not wishing for it.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a bad way to win. We want to see the United States be happy and growing and jobs -- that's
JAMIE DIMON: If for some reason that's not great for JPMorgan's share, so be it.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I guess part of our repayment has just been a mix to much higher quality clients, more transactor clients. So some of that was expected. It's going to stabilize soon and so, no, the rate may not actually change at one point. We'll eventually have growth in the portfolio anyway.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, so I'm saying, and I do this by business, okay. If you are a company right below the G-SIFI, and some of these G-SIFI's or SIFI's have a lot more capital, you may start losing business because of that because it might be easier for Boards and investors and people to say, you know what, leave those deposits with the G-SIFI, put it over here. So I'm saying it may become a small competitive disadvantage for the non-SIFI. And so I could see that you're going to -- I could see you might hear from some of the smaller banks that they're going to be forced to hold the higher capital numbers for competitive reasons. I don't know about that, but I'm just -- look, I think it would be a lot -- I think when you do something like this, like a G-SIFI where they're going to give all these reasons why you have to do it, I think it's going to cause a lot of distortions which are hard to figure out today. I think we'll win some business because of it. I think there are things not on the balance sheet because of it. I think you're going to see some small banks complain about it, not realizing that it's going to hurt them competitively. So I think -- I just think you'll see a lot of toing and froeing and because of this issue.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, I think you're probably right. It would be more in the global wholesale businesses than maybe the consumer side.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I'm not talking about any one particular person, but there are 50 state Attorney Generals. And so it's a complex issue which I think is why it's taking so long to resolve some of this stuff. Like I said, I think it's in everyone's interest to resolve it.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know the answer to that. I think we've been very careful in our FHA underwriting. But I can't tell you what other actors are going to do or there have been so many flaws in mortgages that it's just -- it's been an unmitigated disaster. We really need to clean it up for the sake of everybody. And everybody is going to sue everybody else and it's going to go on for a long time.
JAMIE DIMON: Not necessarily. There's been no change of strategy because there's been a change in management. But I would always ask Todd. You can rethink it -- if you think we should do something different, different places, different types of branches, different locations, different pace you should tell us and we don't mind changing our plans. But there don't change right now. Remember, a lot of that is building out where we are. It can make a lot of sense even though it may not be a macro thing, but you still might want to build out cities where you don't have enough branches.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we think they're responsible for the private-label issues that came out of WaMu. We bought the assets and certain liabilities and we don't think that was one of the liabilities we bought. I'm sure that will be in litigation too.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, the CVA was --.
JAMIE DIMON: A wash -- it was a wash.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know. We break it out part by business. So we expect the core bank will grow with the core bank will grow probably with the trends and we think Middle Market will grow faster than middle market trends. Small business was up what, 28% or some huge number. We think that will grow faster than middle market trends. Credit Card we think will grow faster -- we have a little bit of runoff left but it will grow faster. And then the obviously offset mortgages. There's a huge mortgage runoff, that's going to continue forever.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I think the home equity product unfortunately is a good product that just was -- became part of the bubble at the end, okay. But the product itself is a good product. And how much did we originate last quarter? We're originating $1 billion or $2 billion a quarter --.
JAMIE DIMON: So we're going to stay in that business. It's just going to be -- that runoff -- it will run off but we're originating what we originated last year. So originations are very different than total balances in this one.
JAMIE DIMON: They'll never go back to where they were.
JAMIE DIMON: During the quarter you had a lot of ins and outs.
JAMIE DIMON: So slow weeks, fast weeks. You know, it was -- but that's -- it's probably more of that than normal this quarter. But --.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the way to just look at it is that the retail branch -- it's not a major runoff, we've been doing 120 branches forever. And we're just talking about increasing it to 150, 175, maybe 200. But, so I think you'll see the retail branch expansions grow over time, but not dramatically, just grow over time. The one that you're going to see dramatic changes in expenses eventually will be mortgage. Because we are still bearing high costs related to the high level of defaults, foreclosure expenses, OREO expenses and things like that. And I read all the time that we make more money on defaulted loans or foreclosed loans than we do servicing normal loans; I find that mystifying. I mean, it costs us a fortune to deal with these kinds of things. And so eventually those expenses will come down. And some of those run through the mortgage MSR and some don't.
JAMIE DIMON: For the whole Company or just corporate?
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: WaMu was about a third of our total stuff there.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, folks, well thank you very much for spending time with us and we'll talk to you soon.",0.07000000000000006,0.638000000000001,1,0.10133504732096281,0.13249595921919685
41,Q1_2009,"
MIKE CAVANAGH, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Okay, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us here. So let's jump right into the slide presentation that hopefully you all have in front of you. I'll start with some of the key points off the highlights that you see on page one. So starting with profits, overall profit number, $2.1 billion, or $0.40 earnings per share in the quarter. That's on record firm-wide revenues of $27 billion or so and record quarterly pre-tax pre-provision profits of about $13.5 billion. I wanted to make one point up front on the changes in accounting rules. So there was essentially no impact from the accounting rule changes on fair value accounting or impairment, so we had no P&L impact, no P&L benefit, and no improvement in capital through the OCI account from any of those rule changes in the quarter just to be clear. What went on to generate those results, we're going to see business by business in a second, but obviously an outstanding quarter in the investment bank with record revenues and profitability, and also the WaMu integration really benefiting the Retail Banking business, which you'll see again in a few slides further back. On the balance sheet, we feel very good about the strengthening of our balance sheet. So with $87.2 billion of tangible common equity, that's up a couple of billion dollars from last quarter obviously on these earnings and with the benefit of retaining capital after reducing our dividend, that amounted to 7.2% of risk-weighted assets, so the component of Tier 1 capital made up of tangible common equity all by itself exceeds the 6% well capitalized level of which the preponderance is intended to be common equity. We feel great about the capital position and including preferreds, Tier 1 capital is 11.3%. If you were to exclude the TARP capital, at 9.2%, and remember, we always guided and managed towards an 8 to 8.5% Tier 1-type level. So at these very high levels, we feel very, very good about the capital position of the company. Lastly here, we added $4.2 billion to the allowance for loan loss reserves. Total is at $28 billion. Coverage ratio to loans of 4.53%. You'll see some staggeringly high coverage ratios when you go through the businesses with the investment bank nearing 6%, so obviously very strong reserves. The backdrop there, I'll just make a comment here, is that you'll see that net charge-offs did worsen in the quarter, but in line with what our expectations were back at Investor Day and also our forward view on where losses go from here is upward, but again generally consistent with what we were talking about last time. So now moving on, I'm going to skip page two, which I just referred to all the important numbers, so now let's dive into the investment bank on slide three. So here again, you see the extremely strong results we had in the investment bank in the quarter. Record net income, you see it circled at $1.6 billion on record revenue of $8.3 billion. Walking down some of the lines here, you see that we had investment banking fees of $1.4 billion, up year-over-year on the strength of the very strong quarter end debt underwriting and that fee number, $1.4 billion, is number one on the Street in fees earned for the quarter and, again, you'll see on the next slide, the outstanding lead stable standings we have across our corporate finance franchise. Moving down, you see Fixed Income Markets, $4.9 billion of revenues. That does include $400 million or so of benefit due to our spread widening, but even net of that, we cleared the previous record quarter by a wide margin. And those results really coming across the board with record results in credit trading, emerging markets and rates, also very strong currencies, commodities and so forth. We had markdowns, and you'll see the slides here on our risky assets of about $700 or so million on the legacy leverage loan commitments and that included some markdowns on our auto positions. There are also auto markdowns in reserve builds in other parts of the investment bank results here. And in addition in Fixed Income Markets, about $200 million million of markdowns related to the mortgage position, which you'll see in another slide or two. Moving on to Equities, record, again, record revenues of $1.8 billion, that includes about $200 million of spread widening benefits, but still the $1.6 billion all by itself, that would be left still a record results and that's coming across the board, cash, derivatives, and prime services, where we are gaining, continue to gain share in these businesses across the board, seeing the benefits of everything we've done, including the benefit of the Bear merger coming through. Moving to credit costs out of revenues, you see we had $1.2 billion of credit costs in the investment bank. Virtually all of that was reserve building, just $36 million, or 21 basis points of actual losses in the quarter. And as I said earlier, the loan loss coverage ratio here, 6.68% in the first quarter of reserves to loans. So an outstandingly high number that we haven't seen before. And that is it for the investment bank's P&L. Now let me move on and you see on slide four, you can read this for yourself, but it just demonstrates the outstanding performance in our corporate finance franchise as you look down the page and see us maintaining very, very high rankings across the board in investment banking. Slide five just gives you a recap. We're getting to the level now in our investment bank and risk exposures that we've talked about that are getting to be much less noteworthy than when we started doing this, but nonetheless, let me just touch on them. So we marked down our leverage loans by another $700 million in the quarter. That leaves us with $11.5 billion of face value commitments from a peak of $44 billion when you include what we took on from Bear Stearns. Those loans now marked down by $6 billion, or 52%, to a carrying value of $5.5 billion. So on average, $0.48 on the dollar. Moving on to slide six, you have our mortgage-related exposures in the investment bank and here as we've said before, I'll just point out this is everything we have in these mortgage categories, including what is our ongoing sales and trading inventory in these businesses, as well as our legacy assets. So when you look at the table in the upper left, at the bottom you see the circled numbers that exposure is down by $2 billion in the quarter to $12.7 billion, or about 14% in the quarter. Again, no impact from the fair value accounting changes here. So with that $2 billion of exposure reduction, $1.8 billion was sales activity sold at or around our marks and the remaining 200 of reduction was the markdowns that I described. Moving on now to slide seven, we'll shift gears to Retail Financial Services. So you start at the top. These are some of the key drivers of what drives the P&L that we'll look at in another second. So $346 billion of deposits, obviously up dramatically year-over-year on the benefit of having the WaMu transaction done. The WaMu balance, just to note the deposit balance is remaining stable, despite the fact that we continue to not be a price chaser on deposits and so overall, overall deposits up 2% for the whole business with stability in WaMu. Then when you look down some of these other statistics that show activities through our branches, we continue to invest in the branches, and so you see the sales activity and checking account, 25 million checking accounts now, up about half a million accounts just in the last quarter alone, and then great growth in credit card sales, mortgage originations through the branches. Consumer lending at the bottom, you see in these categories that I show here a total of $46 billion of loan originations in the quarter for total retail, when you include small business, which is in the retail banking segment, we had more than $60 billion of originations of loans, new loans extended. More than $150 billion in the quarter for the firm, including the commercial side. Obviously mortgage loan originations down themselves year-over-year and up quarter over quarter at $38 billion and that both reflects the benefits of the refi activity, offset in part by our moving away from the broker channel on a risk basis. Auto share going up with $6 billion of originations there. So we'll come back to credit stats in the Consumer Lending side in a minute, but let's first go now to slide eight and look at the P&L for Retail Financial Services for one second. So if you look at, on the left side, you've got the circled numbers show overall profits in Retail of $474 million and that breaks down to profits of nearly $900 million in the Retail Banking side, up $300 or so million from last year, and a $389 million loss in the Consumer Lending side. So just talking through those a bit, in Retail Banking, profits up dramatically, again. That's on revenues of $4.3 billion in total. The big drivers versus a year ago being the benefit of having the WaMu deal done, plus wider deposit spreads and higher fees in the system there. A little bit of addition to credit costs and reserves on the business banking portfolio that's in retail banking and then expenses, a little bit of growth there. That includes and you'll see this in many businesses, so I'll just mention it once, the higher fees we're paying for FDIC insurance premiums. In Consumer Lending, the loss on $4.5 billion of total revenue, again, WaMu transaction being the biggest year-over-year change. In addition in the quarter, we had $1 billion of MSR risk management results and some wider loan spreads on the mortgage lending activity. Credit costs is a big story in consumer lending and you'll see that on a few slides. But the one thing I'll mention here is of the total $4.2 billion of reserve adds at the firm, $1.6 billion relates to this consumer lending activities shown here in total. So now let's go to a few of the big portfolios, as we usually do, start with home equity on slide nine. So again, what you're looking at is the total -- I'll just note that all these slides exclude WaMu credit impaired loans, which that portfolio behaving in line with our expectations, so there's been no impact on our results related to the marked portfolios we took on from WaMu in the quarter. Focusing on what's, aside from that, the noncredit impaired loans here you see in the upper right box, $112 billion or so end of period portfolio, down a bit from last quarter, so this will be trending lower over time. Charge-offs of just about $1.1 billion in the quarter, obviously up dramatically from last quarter, but in line with the expectations we talked about going back to Investor Day. Down at the bottom, no real noteworthy comments on where the losses come from that are different from before or our tightened underwriting standards. And then in terms of guidance, again, we'll likely see this start to increase maybe by a couple hundred million dollars into next quarter, trending towards a level as high as $1.4 billion per quarter, which is consistent at what Charlie talked about at Investor Day. Moving on now to slide 10, prime mortgage, so here's a smaller portfolio that's concentrated in a few more recent vintage years. $65.4 billion of balances, about flat to last quarter, again, in the upper right, dollar charge-offs in the quarter, $312 million, up again from last quarter, and then down at the bottom our guidance here is losses could be as high as $500 million over the next several quarters coming up. And that's at the high end, a touch higher than the high end that we talked about at Investor Day of $475 million. In subprime then, on slide 11, not much new here at all. It's a runoff portfolio, the 15.3 from last quarter trending down to just under $15 billion, $364 million, of dollar charge-offs and that's going to be in this range that we talk about at the bottom of $375 million to $475 million in the coming quarters, completely consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. WaMu integration now on slide 12 to finish up retail, I said earlier that we're doing fine on the stability of deposit balances here and then just the major phases of getting WaMu fully integrated by the end of the year, I get to use pictures for the first time in one of these. You see the pictures at the bottom showing the rebranding we just did last weekend of all of our branches in California, and then continued to be on track with the cost saves that we talked about, substantial cost saves higher than what we originally modeled in the deal, nearly $3 billion offset in part by substantial investments in sales people, the facilities coming over from WaMu, and so forth, of nearly $0.75 billion. So continued to invest and grow in this franchise and it's performing well for us in the overall P&L as well, in line with our expectations in terms of its income contribution in retail. Moving on to slide 13, Card, I'll remind you again here, this business includes the runoff WaMu subprime card portfolio in the overall business here in the P&L, but when I talk about all the statistics, I'll focus on the legacy, the core Chase portfolio for consistency's sake, but overall, a loss of $475 million. Just moving down to some of the circled number and the key stats again for Chase alone, you see that we had $150 billion of end of period outstandings, about flat year-over-year, and down a touch seasonally, as you would expect quarter over quarter. Total sales volume on cards obviously coming down in this environment, but we believe are gaining share, so 16% decline quarter over quarter and 9% year-over-year. The share gains coming from our focus on partner programs and reward activities that, again, we talked about on Investor Day. So those two things combined drive the $5.1 billion of revenues you see at the top, but what's really driving the bottom line is credit costs, so total credit costs inclusive of WaMu, $4.7 billion in the first quarter. That includes a $1.2 billion addition to loan loss reserves. Charge-offs themselves, and I'll talk Chase only, 6.86% charge-off ratio in the quarter, up from last quarter, and just inside of the 7% for first quarter guidance that we gave going back to the beginning of the year at Investor Day. And that Chase alone number, again, as we look toward the end of the year, will follow where unemployment goes and just as a for instance, you got to pick that, but as a for instance, we said if we end the year at 9% unemployment, we said we can expect to be in a Chase charge-off range of 9 to 9.5% and we'll probably move up 200 basis points from where we are this quarter in the second quarter. WaMu itself will go up from levels more in the high teens to low 20% rates from where they are now, which is around 12% because it's still benefiting from some purchase accounting. Commercial banking now, on slide 14, here you see profits of $338 million. And our return on equity is 17% in the quarter where we're starting to get back to more normalized charge-off rates of 48 basis points overall and we added a little over $100 million to loan loss reserves in the commercial bank, bringing total loan loss reserves to nearly $3 billion and a coverage ratio of reserves to loans of 2.59%. Balances, liability balances at $115 billion in loans and leases at $114 billion, together driving revenues of $1.4 billion. I will just note that inside the revenues for the quarter in the investment bank, noninterest revenue, so what we get from fees of all sorts, non-lending and non-deposit-related revenues, are at a record level, so we've always talked about the importance of making this a deep share of our customers' activities, including fees, so I feel good about the revenue line in the business. A little bit off from last quarter on decline in spreads and some of the deposit products. Moving on to slide 15, Treasury and Security Services, here we had net income of $308 million, down 24% year-over-year and down substantially quarter over quarter. I'll just take you to the liability balances, the deposit balances. You see the circled numbers. $277 billion, that's off from the fourth quarter levels where we saw the very high activities in terms of client deposits coming in in the fourth quarter, given all the market turbulence at the end of 2008. So as that's come off, you see that flowing through the revenue side across both pieces of business here. Assets under custody, about flat quarter over quarter. So when you get then to revenues of $1.8 billion, down close to 20% quarter over quarter, the big driver of that is in the security services, so these securities lending businesses, and so there we both had activity levels and spreads in securities lending come off as those business activities for the market have eased off the levels they were running at. And then together with the lower liability balances, lower deposit balances I just referred to and lower spreads in a low interest rate environment gets you to that level of revenues. Just a little guidance on where to go from here, we would expect that this level, or plus or minus $2 billion of quarterly revenues in treasury and security services is a reasonable expectation, given what we've seen in the, in this first quarter here coming out of the end of last year. Then on slide 16, let's go to Asset Management here starting at really the assets under management. $1.1 trillion, down year-over-year a bit, that's market declines driving Asset Management, assets under management down by close to $200 billion, but positive inflows of about $120 billion year-over-year offsetting that in part, albeit in a greater balance of liquidity projects which are obviously lower margin. That gets you then to the 10% year-over-year decline in revenues to $1.7 billion coming off of everything I just said and that drops you down to net income for the business of the $224 million here, that you see here. Finally, on the income statement, we have the last piece, which is on Slide 17, the corporate segment. So here you see we had losses, bottom line losses of $280 million in private equity. That's on $462 million of writedowns in the quarter. Our corporate segment, $252 million of profit, obviously there's a lots of ins and outs in corporate that I won't go through. I'll just say that we expect that to trend higher going into the second quarter by a few hundred million dollars, given the benefits that we'll accrue from the investment portfolio, which is obviously larger as we talked about back at Investor Day. And then lastly, we run our WaMu and Bear Stearns-related merger costs, which are in line with what we expected through the corporate segment here, and that's $234 million after-tax, or about $0.06 that's embedded in our $0.40 overall profit number. So $0.46 before the costs of the merger-related items. Now moving on, and just recapping again on capital, slide 18, here you see the $87 billion of tangible common equity, up several billion dollars from last quarter is the circled number. Above that is the $112 billion, is what we have given the preferreds we have outstanding and qualified trust preferreds that are normally there. And then if you -- and that's again, ex-TARP. It's $137 billion with TARP. When you move down to the ratios, I've already hit these, but it's 11.3% Tier 1 ratio in total, 9.2% just using the non-TARP-related Tier 1 and 7.2% in tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets. And then finally, I'll just show you again the loan loss reserve build, which is obviously a large number here, so $27 billion of loan loss reserves to loans, up $20 billion from $7.3 billion two years ago, end of first quarter of 2007. Obviously you see that in the green stacked bars on the total bar on these slides coming up from left to right in the upper hatchet you see the line just showing how we've been improving the loan loss to reserve to loans ratio, which is now standing at 4.53% and as we move through the credit cycle, you see in the blue bar, in the top table our NPLs as we move through a cycle coming up and therefore just the mass at the NPL to reserve 10 PL ratio now sitting at 241%. In the bottom right, you can look at this yourself, but you see -- sorry, bottom left, you see how we stack up at the end of last quarter versus peers. So we obviously feel very strongly reserved when you look at the peers here. And finally, then outlook slide, I think we hit basically everything that's on here already. I will just point out that we -- in the overall box in the bottom right, we do have ahead of us in the latter part of the year an FDIC assessment coming that is still being finalized and that could be in the range of three quarters of a billion to $1.5 billion. On top of the actual ongoing FDIC charges which are higher all by themselves year over year and already running through our first quarter numbers. So with that, I will hand it over to Jamie, or actually we'll just open it up for questions. Operator?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Good morning, Guy.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: So I think we've been fairly consistent on TARP, which is we would like to repay it as soon as possible. We're waiting for guidance from the government of the United States. We want to do what's in the interest of the United States in addition to it's in the interest in JPMorgan and obviously we have the wherewithal. Mike mentioned we have 7.2% tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets. That's a higher number than a lot of people have. Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, which is now over 9% not including TARP. The 9% and the 7% wouldn't change if TARP were repaid. Obviously we're in the pretty strong position with that and we don't think we need more capital. But we obviously will await the results of the stress test and guidance from the government and see what happens.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know what we need to do because it may not be solely up to us. I don't think we need it.
JAMIE DIMON: Yeah, so, you all know I don't pay that much attention to VAR, okay, but a lot of that is just hedge positions.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
JAMIE DIMON: If you look at the balance sheet of the Investment Bank, it's about the same size it was before we bought Bear Stearns and I would say the real risk is lower because the legacy loans are dramatically lower, mortgage stuff is dramatically lower and so it's in pretty good shape.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And not just down year-over-year, but also down something like 15% quarter over quarter. So it continues to be a focus.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's the latter. Fundamentally no impact.
JAMIE DIMON: It was adopted and it had no impact. The whole thing was a big hullabaloo about nothing in my opinion.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. So the three auto companies, direct exposure, okay, and remember, I think Mike mentioned that in the quarter obviously they were both reserves and marks in the quarter and in prior quarters relating to auto. But if the three companies are total exposure, in other words, how much could we possibly lose at the far end, it would be well less than $1 billion. We have exposure to the finance companies, mostly collateralized, we could lose money there. It really depends, there the situation gets bad under Chapter 7, not under Chapter 11s, but really remains to be seen what other people do. We can lose money there, but we'll see. And obviously we have exposures to suppliers both in the Commercial Bank and the investment bank and they are within -- you're basically already seeing a lot of that stress in the balance sheet.
JAMIE DIMON: All right.
JAMIE DIMON: Hi, John.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a lot less than a guess, okay? We do have real visibility into the second quarter already. It is based upon real rates and real delinquencies.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Beyond that, you got to make your own assumption about where unemployment goes and you can just go back. The point I was making about the latter end of the year, as we showed a bunch of different relationships of where our losses might be on the Chase portfolio relative to unemployment and so that stands,
JAMIE DIMON: Well, it's subprime and it's part of the cost of getting the WaMu deal and that's our expectations for it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We're not immediately concerned about that stuff, John. Paying attention to it, but not a, not an immediate concern.
JAMIE DIMON: And fixable if we want to.
JAMIE DIMON: I think you should expect the net interest margin to be approximately the same going forward and there's been some repricing, but it's not going to have a dramatic effect.
JAMIE DIMON: Hi, Mike.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Hi, Mike.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we don't accrue comp to revenue, comp as a percent of revenue. It's accrued kind of by line -- capital adjusted and all of that, and that was the number. If it was higher or lower, that would be fine with us. But if you look at the actual accrual amount, it was pretty high.
JAMIE DIMON: No, no, it's just the first quarter. Obviously you don't pay comp until you get to the end of the year.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The comp to revenue is just an expression of the outcome, Mike. It's not the driver of how we think about it. So consistent to the way we've done it before and in a strong quarter like this, the percentage comes out the way it did.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, I don't know about nonlinear, but in any market where unemployment is up, and actually we had charts at the analyst meeting for this, you just take them out, I think it's approximately the same today as it was then. That wherever unemployment goes up, charge-offs are going up. Wherever home prices go down, charge-offs are going up and we're both -- charge-ups go up even more. So if you do a correlation, they would be directly correlated to unemployment and home prices, too. It's hard to kind of tease them out. But charge-offs in card are clearly higher than you would expect just based upon unemployment and that's because of housing.
JAMIE DIMON: All right.
JAMIE DIMON: If you look in prime mortgage, distorted delinquencies a little bit, but we're actively trying to do the mod program -- it's hard to really tell, Mike and I think it's a good thing for the country to go ahead and do that, but we don't exactly know what the impact will be. Obviously it will be more foreclosures going forward, but there will also be a lot more people who are able to do a modification or a refi.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning, Meredith.
JAMIE DIMON: No. Let me just do MSR real quick. First of all, we like to be fairly conservative in how we do stuff. We think we're fairly conservative in MSR, too. But in general, over time, certain prepayment speeds have slowed and home turnovers gone down a little bit, not a little bit, I think it's gone down a lot. It's things like that. Obviously there's a lot of things in that model -- we don't expect to see a billion dollar benefit every quarter on the risk -what we call the risk management side of the MSR, but the MSR is a real earning asset.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, relative to us alone, it's really not that big a deal, okay, because subprime is $13 billion in mortgage and the whole Providian book is $26 billion. Remember, Meredith, I really think that happened a year ago, that subprime markets were in essence closed. I think you're seeing the full effect of the impact for that now.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Which is why I think we've been more on track with the forecasting.
JAMIE DIMON: No.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And that's not news. We had said that before.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning, Betsy.
JAMIE DIMON: I would kind of point overall we're getting just comments on NIM, get a little bit of spread compression and deposits in some of the businesses and then the benefit of the larger investment portfolio, so benefiting from a lower interest rate there. That's the aggregate story, continues to be the story looking ahead for at least a little while until we have a different view on rates.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And year-over-year was pretty much addition of WaMu, big difference.
JAMIE DIMON: So I think we're different than most because we've always looked at -- we want each company to be properly capitalized. In effect, we didn't subsidize any company by looking at the whole company and the whole company itself wasn't overleveraged, so we don't expect our positional change very much going forward.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And remember, we also always targeted, as I said earlier, a Tier 1 ratio of 8 to 8.5%, well above the 6%, in light of times could get tougher and so had some of the pro cyclicality, some of that stuff taken out by ourselves. Also we were always very conscious of how much we wanted to rely on, other than tangible common equity, as a source of regulatory capital. Think about the 15% bucket for trust preferreds as an example, as something we availed ourselves of, but not much more. Which is why you see such a strong quality of our capital today.
JAMIE DIMON: I think it's fair that there will be less leverage in the financial system going forward.
JAMIE DIMON: General. That will be true for diversified companies and less diversified companies.
JAMIE DIMON: We have no intent on using PPIP at all. We don't need it. We have our own assets. If we want to sell them, we'll sell them. We mark them properly. If -- if we want to buy them, we'll buy them. We're certainly not going to borrow from the federal government because we've learned our lesson about that and -- but I do think that a PPIP is properly executed, it could be good for the system because it could give some prices to certain loans and help some companies do things they might not otherwise have been able to do. But I don't think that in and of itself is that critical to the success of all the programs that the treasury is doing. And if you look at the program the treasury and the fed and the government, stimulus package, there's an extensive amount of programs. That's only one of them.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, remember, TLGP had asymmetric benefits for people, okay, and when that all happened, I would say some people couldn't fund at all and were able to and some people were able to fund a lot cheaper than they were able to fund. It wasn't a lot cheaper. I think it's maybe 100 basis points.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And in the short end, our issuance has come in a lot relative to what unguaranteed issuance -- what unguaranteed issuance would be versus guaranteed obviously.
JAMIE DIMON: Our cost would be 100 basis points higher, something like that. And we did an unguaranteed deal and those markets will come back eventually. You've seen January, February, March are some of the biggest bond months ever, which includes high yield debt, double-D, single-B, some IPOs, so the Capital Markets will eventually get healthy again and people finance.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Doesn't that mean spreads come back all the way to where they were, but we don't necessarily need or expect that to happen.
JAMIE DIMON: No, because it's not that big a deal for us. Betsy, we have $1 trillion of deposits and $700 billion of loans. So, you know, if our non-deposit costs go up a little bit, that will just how you change stuff going forward or manage stuff going forward, but I would say it's not a tremendous deal for us. It could be a tremendous deal for some other people. They either won't get the money or it's going to cost them 500 basis points more, and that basically eliminates profit.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Good morning, Jeff.
JAMIE DIMON: So in the big picture, it isn't a big deal for us either, so I think we've given this number at the Investor Day, was it $12 billion in total?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yeah, $7 billion or so from legacy Chase and then we picked up another $5 billion or so from WaMu in construction -- in commercial.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, and I think in general, there the losses are going up and I think if you talk about the whole system, in my opinion, you are going to see rapidly rising charge-offs in real estate loans. It will be idiosyncratic, all things are done differently and have different standards and they even define them kind of differently. We also had the middle, the multifamily lending for losses, which is over $30 billion out of WaMu. Losses are extremely low. I would completely separate that. I would expect losses to go up, but not nearly on the category of commercial real estate.
MIKE CAVANAGH: So a lot of it's going to be, when you look at commercial, what's the mix? As we talked about that, that totals, $14-ish billion. Loss rates are trending higher, but probably not as high as in some of the weakest lending into that space, so that is something to be watchful of, but I think it's our size and mix that's the reason we feel good.
JAMIE DIMON: No, that's -- we had a net $1 billion gain on the risk management of the MSR. That will not repeat.
JAMIE DIMON: It's the net, it's the net of us hedging the expected change in the asset. So however you want to say it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You've seen -- that is a very volatile number by quarter. Obviously it's been a positive recently, but we don't expect it to continue.
JAMIE DIMON: Right, so first thing to point out is the investment bank, both on the corporate finance side and the sales and trading side has been doing extremely well and some of that is gaining share. It's hard to tell the gain in share in the short run fixed income, et cetera. Very good results in emerging markets, FX, currencies. Obviously the corporate bond market is back in a big way, prime is coming back in a big way, and spreads are way up. Spreads are way up. Volumes have gone up. People obviously still need the services, so we think we've gained share. I wouldn't expect to see them at these high levels continuing going forward. I think the first quarter was historically high quarter and if you were looking at it, it's not reasonable to expect to continue at that level. Where we hope the share we've gained that we're going to hold.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, you've mixed whole bunch of things in there, but we added $4 billion to reserves. Okay. $1 billion of that was in the Investment Bank and then -- remember, the Investment Bank, you had $1 billion of reserves. It also took $1 billion of varying marks on loans and mortgages, but they had $1 billion gain in DVA. Add it all together -- underlying trend was overall better than what you're seeing here than on their own. Look, we reserve each book of business according to accounting rules for that book of business and in general, on the consumer side, as you're looking forward, expected losses over the next 12 months. Eventually they will peak, but they have been going up consistently. We've shown you here that they are going to go up even more, they are going to continue to go up in all the home lending areas, mortgage and home equity. Credit card will continue to go up. As long as they continue to go up, reserves will have to be added too. Once they stop going up, you don't have to add to reserves anymore. That will be a joyous quarter. It may happen sooner than you think, and it may take a little bit longer.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know which number you're looking at, James, but if you look at adjusted assets, taking out the match book, you're down quarter over quarter, 14% I think it is, so it's the combined set of activities, making sure we're getting paid for the risk we take and discipline and managed balance sheet and getting the Bear balance sheet integrated. All of those factors drive quarter over quarter decline and back to levels of the year ago.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think the contributor was down $30 billion, too, which is a huge number.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Remember, that bounces all over the place.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, listen, you made the point as well as anyone could make it, and at one point it's sufficient. And I think loan loss reserving as a matter of policy really needs to be reviewed in the future. I mean, it's very pro cyclical. It doesn't in my opinion match revenues and expenses, but a lot of it recognizes real losses that are coming, so -- but at one point, those loan losses will come down. We agree with you, as a policy matter it really needs to be reviewed, but that's not up to us. And I think the market looks right through it.
MIKE CAVANAGH: And that's why it's important to look at the quality of your capital in light of the quality and size of the loan loss reserve relative to forward exposures.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Elevated conversations. I wouldn't expect to see much take place in this, at least in the short run.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We kind of know what you know. We're not going to -- we haven't heard back from the government. They are targeting toward the end of the month, as you read in the papers, and that's kind of where I would leave it. We talked about at our Investor Day, our own stress work, which as we talked about, , put us in good stead, maintaining our capital at levels like we currently have on the back of earnings and profits, even in our own scenarios and I still feel good about our own scenarios for what they were having done all the work involved in submitting our government stress test. So that's where I would leave it for now. But as Jamie said, we've got to wait to hear what the government thinks of it, all things considered on their side in a few weeks, I
JAMIE DIMON: Right now looks like it will creep up from there, but we really don't know because we don't have that much visibility, and particularly like in the third or fourth quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: There is no question that the home markets are much more active in California, that the affordability to pay is at all-time records there. The home prices are already down 40 or 50%, depending what market you're in. We know in our own experience, homes are moving much faster, they're more busy, the prices are much closer to the offer price, so those are all very positive signs in California. But we don't, we'll see what actually happens to home prices over time.
JAMIE DIMON: No, because remember, a lot of those losses are almost embedded in the fact that home price is down 40 or 50%, and unemployment is going up and so some of those losses are embedded. Obviously the sooner home prices stabilize, the better we'll be for home lending portfolios.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It was pretty much -- it was spread across all pieces, John, so prime services did improve some, but it's not the totality, by any stretch of -- in the revenue increase.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, year-over-year we didn't have it last year and we really don't talk about this a lot, but the Bear Stearns equity business was very strong and also helped the cash equity side and the prime brokerage side where we think we've gained share. If you look at all the [inaudible] stuff like that, somewhat off the back of Bear Stearns, too. Obviously we were very strong in the equity derivatives side.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I would say it's actually in the home lending side, it's just low levels of losses period as we showed at Investor Day, just given that anything that was low quality was put into credit impaired and marked, so you just have a much higher credit quality in mortgage and so forth that stayed in the accrual books. And then in card, as I said, you do have, because of the quick revolve of the balances, you take the losses in the initial purchase accounting there, but as I said, normalized this quarter, we had about 12, 13% charge-off rate on WaMu cards. That benefits the last quarter a little bit of benefit of booking losses up front. So that normalized would have been more like 16, 17% and that's why next quarter it will be something like 18% on that $26 billion alone, which is mostly the benefit of initial purchase accounting going away.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yep.
JAMIE DIMON: Guy, you don't have any more questions you want?
MIKE CAVANAGH: Okay.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay, folks.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Thank you, everybody.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",0.09000000000000002,-1.162000000000001,0,0.10603267315945512,0.112826025368261
42,Q2_2017,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO AND EVP, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported record net income of $7 billion, EPS of $1.82 and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $26.4 billion. Included in the result is a legal benefit of approximately $400 million after tax from a previously announced settlement involving the FDIC's Washington Mutual receivership. Other notable items, predominantly net reserve changes and legal expense, were a small net negative this
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I would just stop for a second to just point out that what Jamie actually said was, ""This is uncharted territory. It's not something that we've seen before."" And so while it is the case that the Fed is communicating clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable, things can change, and we should just be prepared for that. Not to say that, that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on JPMorgan but that, that would just be a downside risk, not a probability. So on the balance sheet, it's still the case that we expect to start seeing normalization in the balance sheet in September; if not in September, by the end of this year. And we're still actually calling for the next rate hike in December; the market is calling for March of next year. And as we said, the communication has been pretty consistent and pretty clear across the Fed space, which is to say that it's mostly priced into the market at this point as far as we can tell. And so based upon what we've understood, all things equal, we would see the balance sheet shrink about $1.5 trillion over about the next 4 years. So that would ultimately slow growth, not stop growth. And if we saw $1 billion -- sorry, $1.5 trillion come out of the Fed's balance sheet, empirical evidence would suggest that we don't see dollar-for-dollar reduction in deposits. So if you just pick a point between $500 billion and $1 trillion of deposit outflows, at our 10% market share, that would be about $75 billion over 4 years. So it would slow growth. It would not stop growth. And it is what we've been expecting and what we've been talking about now for an extended period, and gradual is good in that sense. In respect of which deposits we would like to see, so that's the sort of growth scenario. In terms of liquidity, again, evidence would suggest, and we've been communicating this quite clearly, that we think the preponderance of that deposit outflow would be wholesale deposits and that would -- it would be nonoperating deposits. And those are deposits we ascribe little to no liquidity value to. So assuming that we're close to right, we would see those deposits ultimately leave the system, but it wouldn't affect materially, if at all, our liquidity position. So ultimately, the yield curve has priced, I think, all of this in. What I think the Fed had been clear about is that they expect the balance sheet or hope the balance sheet to be in the background and to use short rates as their primary monetary policy tool. And so as a result, we would ultimately expect to see perhaps a flattening yield curve, but with the front end ultimately pulling the long end up. And you heard Yellen -- Chair Yellen talk about being conscious of the shape of the curve as they go about normalization. I think you may have asked something else. Did I miss anything?
MARIANNE LAKE: No, we -- that's correct. If you saw the -- compared to a $400 million expectation, we were up $150 million. So it would be fair to say that most of it was in this quarter. We had also -- when we gave the last set of guidance at $4.5 billion, we pointed out that the 10-year was low and that, that was ultimately pressuring that $4.5 billion. So it really isn't that significant of a change. The only thing I would caution you to remember is that when we think about asset sensitivity and we think about NII, market NII, which we wouldn't consider to be, in a traditional sense, core, can exhibit volatility geographically with NIR. If you think about a market-making business where we can have assets that are throwing off NII hedged by derivatives that ultimately have an offset in NIR, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers. So there could be a little noise in there, but no, I'm not expecting there to be significant changes. But I think what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished. And chasing our tails, reforecasting the full year NII every 3 quarters isn't as important -or every quarter isn't as important as keeping our eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed. We are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the banking book assets and liabilities, and that means that our long-term projections will be good and the path is a little bit less important.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I understand why you're asking. As you look at the loan yields, they look relatively flat or even slightly down. If you adjust for the mortgage, it would be flat. If you decompose them into wholesale versus retail, we are absolutely seeing all of the yield improvement on the wholesale side, about 10-ish basis points. And on the consumer side, at this -- with respect to this quarter, there were some mix impacts in the Card business as we saw a higher level of transactors and saw a few other things. So it's not to say that the loan yields aren't moving in line with our expectations, and they are, but mix will matter for any one quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, that's right. And if you look back last quarter, they did, too. It's just that we've had a couple of opposing things going on this quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So obviously, one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in card revenues has been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new Chase Sapphire Reserve accounts. And so the end of the third quarter both -- importantly, both the fourth quarter and the first quarter were extraordinary in terms of the number of accounts we acquired. And of course, we amortize or contra revenue out those expenses over 1 year. So at 10.5% revenue rate right now and with those -- having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into the second quarter, we will see ultimately -- we'll lap that impact a year from now. And we'll see our revenue rate start improving from here towards the 11.25% that we sort of guided to in the medium term. And we expect to get to that point, all other things equal, kind of mid-next year. And of course, that's just one facet. We're also seeing significant momentum on the sales front. Obviously, as a result of those accounts, we're growing our core loans, up 8%. And so we're having higher NII on those balances. So there's a lot of dry powder. We just need to get past these account acquisition costs, which we will. And I always feel compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers. Their characteristics, their engagement, their spend, these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have them, and we intend to deepen relationships with them.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would characterize our strategy as unchanged. We've always been pretty consistent over an extended period that we would prioritize, first and foremost, strategic investments for growth in our businesses, be that organic or otherwise. And obviously, you've seen us be investing, whether it's in growing loans or introducing new product, hiring bankers, opening offices in our expansion markets and the like. But yes, it's been heavily skewed to being organic over the most recent while. We've also been pretty clear and active, I would say, in terms of partnering with, investing in, collaborating with partners that can accelerate our growth potential. So we would always be interested, whether that's fintech or otherwise, in getting capabilities that allow us to accelerate our growth potential. We don't have big gaps, but we would always be interested in that. Having said that, I'm not going to comment on the state of the regulatory environment except to say you should expect, for any of these events or transactions, that we would have the appropriate regulators at the -- conversation with regulators at the appropriate time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So obviously, we are supportive of the new hedge accounting rules, and it will allow us to consider taking advantage of hedge accounting for a wiser set of products than we currently do. But we actually have reasonably limited hedge ineffectiveness in our (inaudible) right now. So from a practical perspective, it won't make a big difference to the business, but it is more flexibility in terms of the scope. And we're looking at that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, it's seasonality. So you've seen the first half at or around that guidance level. We would expect that to go down slightly just from seasonality in the second half for a full year a bit below 3%.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say, obviously anytime you reach an inflection point, you need to be cautious about understanding the pace of change. For -- at least for 2018, 3% to 3.25% feels right. I think as -- when you get beyond that, we'll be updating you with our views as we experience a bit more in reality. It doesn't feel significantly different from that, but I think 2018 is a good number. And 2019, we'll update you.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. Okay, so just talk about what we've seen so far, I think the industry has been really quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization in terms of the rate cycle. It is a tale of 2 cities. We've said that (inaudible) the wholesale space necessarily experiences higher reprice more quickly, and we are seeing that pretty much in line with our expectations. It matters, you need to get granular. The type of deposit, that client segmentation, it matters. So in the wholesale space, we're seeing it. We're on that journey. In the retail space, we haven't seen that yet. So while there have been small changes in the industry in CDs, there's been nothing in checking or savings. But again, I'd just point out to you that we wouldn't have expected there to be at this point yet in the cycle. And I would say, with respect to deposit betas and the Fed's balance sheet, if we are right, and we believe we'll be close to right, and that we see the wholesale nonoperating deposit flowing out of the system, assuming everybody else has reached that same conclusion, then it really shouldn't materially impact the liquidity position of financial institutions. And if you couple that with the expectation of a very gradual and measured pace, which gives people a lot of time and opportunity to plan accordingly, we wouldn't expect there to be a significant impact on betas, if any.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. I would say -- first of all, I would say, focusing on any one -- so we would be very supportive of changes to how operational the capital is treated under [reg] capital rules. But I think focusing on one facet and not the whole thing -- it's unlikely to be that only one thing changes. So we'd like to see changes made over time. But for the foreseeable future, as we're growing our loans quite strongly, and these are extraordinarily high-quality loans where the differential between advanced and standardized is quite big, we still expect standardized to bind us.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So whether it's because the operational risk rules change or whether it's because the standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk sensitive, there should be changes over time, but I think for the foreseeable future, this is what we expect.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would start with, if you go back a couple of years ago, 2013, '14, '15, when we were doing our business simplification agenda and derisking and uplifting the controlled environment, the Commercial Bank was blocking and tackling and doing a lot of inwardly focused work. And we talked, I think, all the way back in 2016, that there were outbound calls, opening offices, hiring bankers, and that if you waited a minute, you'd see that come to our results. And this is the sort of fruits of that labor. So I do think it is sustainable. There's nothing in these results that is particularly noisy outside of reserve releases, which I'll come back to. And I would also say the partnership between the Commercial Bank and the IB in terms of covering our clients, the introduction of 16 specialized industries, which is an advantage we can bring to our clients nationally and, in fact, globally, that other competitors can't bring, all of those things set us up for continued solid growth. With respect to loan growth, I would say, if you look at our C&I loans, this quarter, as an example, was pretty broad based. There wasn't a specific -- in the Middle Market, there wasn't a specific industry or market segment that was strong. But over the last -- stronger, I should say. But over the last few years, a lot of our growth has been driven by the investments we've been making in the expansion markets. So we got into some new markets with the WaMu acquisition. We continued to build out those markets, add bankers, open offices. And that has been a source of growth for us that perhaps others haven't been able to enjoy. And also, as I said, specialized industries. And then...
MARIANNE LAKE: All right. And then...
MARIANNE LAKE: And then the only thing I would say on commercial real estate, just because I think it's really important, is commercial real estate, it depends what you do. And more than half of our commercial real estate exposure is Commercial Term Lending. It's a very specific strategy. We don't deviate from that strategy. And I would just point to you, because it was interesting to me, if you look at the Fed's CCAR stress results for commercial real estate across the industry and look at how our results compared to others, I think you can hopefully get somewhat more comfortable, and we are very comfortable with what we have right now. Now that said, the performance this quarter did benefit from reserve releases and benign credit, and at some point, there will be a cycle. But the risk appetite we have and the way we've managed with discipline, we're very happy with that.
MARIANNE LAKE: And then I would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the (inaudible) going, whether you look at Middle Markets, Corporate Client Banking, M&A, it's not to say that the possibilities of reform and the impact that, that could have isn't a part of the dialogue, but they're fundamentally really just getting on with things. And so if there's a client that has a compelling strategic deal to be done or some spending or hiring or growth, then they're pretty much getting on with it, which is why we're seeing solid growth.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, obviously, you know the deal with CCAR approvals, which is it is capacity. It's not necessarily a commitment to utilize it, although we are -- as we fairly clearly articulated at Investor Day and as you see in the numbers here, we are at 12.5% in terms of our CET1. And we believe we ought to be able to, over time, operate the company lower than that, within the range of 11% to 12.5%, albeit that we would take time to do that. So we're in the market buying our stock every day. We're at 1.8x tangible book value. So in Jamie's shareholder letter, we still think that there's significant value in the stock. We believe in the earnings power in the franchise that we have here. And so I'm not to say that we will utilize all the capacity because other things can come up, but we put in the request based upon our desire to want to ultimately move lower.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So obviously, they haven't been specific. Although the Treasury report had some ideas, they haven't been specific about what the calibration would look like and whether there would be recalibration to the numerator and the denominator or one or the other. Clearly, we've been pretty clear that we think cash at central banks shouldn't necessarily be included, and there are other things. Different people have different opinions. So we've done the calculations. I would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding constraints right now, of which leverage in a variety of forms is part of that. So to the degree that we get the opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact at the margin. But we take all of those things into consideration when we think about the direction of travel of the company. So we're being as thoughtful as we can. We are not specifically leverage constrained right now. That doesn't mean we're not supportive of making those changes and we will obviously model it out. But we take the potential for those changes into consideration when we think about the direction we grow our businesses.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think -- I want to point out something because I know that Sapphire Reserve gets a significant amount of attention for obvious and good reasons. But it is only one product in a platform of successful products, both proprietary and co-brand. And so in reality, while we obviously do all the modeling and the math, it's not about what the cost of any one individual card acquired is or the NPV of that, it's how the portfolios ultimately together perform over time. And it's still very early on Sapphire Reserve. I mean, it's not even a year old yet. And these are portfolios and products that develop and season over time. And as I said, these are extraordinarily good customer relationships. So you know we've done a bunch of things in the card business over the last few years. We've renegotiated our co-brands. That was ultimately with lower economics but still very good economics. We've been out on the front foot issuing new products, not just Sapphire Reserve but Freedom Unlimited, the Amazon Prime card, Ink. And so we think about everything in the total portfolio and its collective performance over time, and it's still generating very good returns.
MARIANNE LAKE: So when we think about the sort of liquidity position of this company, we're obviously managing not just to regulatory requirements but also to what we want the ultimate sort of duration of equity and position of our balance sheet to be through the cycle. So we take into consideration not just the amount of liquidity we have and how that could be utilized but also the mortgage portfolio we have, agency MBS. So all of that goes into our determinations. And we will continue to add to duration opportunistically when it makes sense to do it and manage our balance sheet with discipline.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So I would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of CCAR or the next 2 cycles of CCAR. And so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to get the low end of the range but just to operate for the short and medium term within the range while we let all of the potential changes to the sort of regulatory environment at large play out. And so as to whether or not, over time, there's a sort of recalibration of whether 11% is our minimum, that will play out over time. So for the next 1 or 2 cycles of CCAR, this cycle and the next one, I would just expect that we want to be on a measured pace to be within the range to allow us to better understand all of the changes that will take place over time and make appropriate decisions. I wouldn't start imagining necessarily how low that goes. I think we would want to operate with a sufficiency of capital and liquidity.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say, of course, it's possible. We've seen a number of situations where implementing global standards in the U.S. have differed in meaningful ways from how they've been implemented elsewhere. You have rarely seen that be to the advantage of the U.S., and the SLR is no exception. So while there may be recalibrations of either the numerator or denominator, know that to the Europeans, 3% standard. Our current depository institutions are held to a 6% standard. So there's plenty of room for there to be adjustments before it would create an unlevel playing field. And my suspicion is there will also be adjustments elsewhere. And it's supposed to be, as I think Chairman -- Chairwoman Yellen said, a backstop, not binding in the way that perhaps it has become. So I think the answer is yes, but we'll see.
MARIANNE LAKE: And so -- sorry, go ahead.
MARIANNE LAKE: No. So look, there are a number of different people talking about the forward-looking standard for operational risk, Basel -- under Basel III.5 or IV or whatever is talking about it, there were some proposals in the CHOICE Act. So there's no question that there should be a revisitation of the mechanism to calculate operational risk. And then you're right, the way that all of these rules ultimately interplay with each other matters. And so from a pure stress test perspective, at the margin, we had a little bit more binding constraint on leverage than CET1. But if you look at just what we could run the company at if CCAR was the only constraint, it would be lower than where we are. So it's a complicated dynamic of trying to make sure that we're maximizing against all of these constraints and not just the mathematical ones but also the operational and practical ones. So I mean, it's necessary to go back and rethink the calculation of operational risk just because it's the right thing to do. Ultimately, how that plays out into how we optimize against our constraints is less of what we're focused on.
MARIANNE LAKE: I wouldn't imagine -- it's not going to change our risk management strategy in a meaningful way, so I wouldn't imagine it would be...
MARIANNE LAKE: No. It is still this quarter. There are requirements to make public disclosures in August. So depending on whether you make them in your Q, in your Pillar 3 or not will determine whether it's the beginning or middle or end of August. We, as you know, have -- as an industry, are being quite public about the fact that we think -- by the way, we provide an extraordinary amount of real-time granular -- same-day granular information on liquidity to our regulators in order for them to be able to properly supervise not just us but the system. And so we believe the regulators do have and can have anything they need when they need it. It's just a question about whether there is any added benefit of those informations being made public near real time. While it wouldn't matter today when everyone's running very significant liquidity surpluses, it could have unintended consequences if we were in an environment that was more stressful than we are today. So right now, the requirement is that we have to disclose. I suspect, although we've asked for a delay, as an industry, that we might have to disclose. We will continue to debate, I think, with regulators the merits of those public disclosures over time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. And we -- I mean, I would suggest, although it's not something we show you every quarter, that we've been pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split, at least in Investor Day now and then, between operating and nonoperating deposits. And as we start to see the impacts of the Fed balance sheet unwind and the like, we will be very forthcoming. We try to be incredibly transparent, and we'll take that under advisement, regardless of what the regulatory disclosures are about the quality of our deposit franchise. But we have, I think, periodically, been more disclosive than most in terms of the quality of our deposits.
MARIANNE LAKE: And we removed $200 billion of nonoperating deposits proactively. So we manage it very carefully.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.",0.23,-0.01100000000000001,0,0.08688392833502598,0.1180350093712162
43,Q2_2016,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE: Thank you, and good morning everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. While there are no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you'll hear about as I go through the presentation. That strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IBCs compared to the first quarter, as well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer and wholesale and record consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion. Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on two topics that are top of mind. First, an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining. And those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved, which means that underlying the net $50 million reserve build we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB. Although the oil and gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our wholesale or consumer portfolios. Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk-[off] environment. And following the decision the markets were quite volatile, as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance. With respect to next steps, as you know the ultimate relationship between the UK and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and passporting specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and UK clients across businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction costs so that they will be manageable for the Company. Moving on to page 2. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year on year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day, despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve, and as industry deposit read prices to date have remained low, coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. Non-interest revenue was flat year on year, with the increase in markets revenue being offset by declines in IBCs as well as Asset Management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect full-year expense of $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the [FDI] surcharge in the third and fourth quarters. Moving onto capital on page 3. The Firm's advanced fully phased in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation, with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6%, as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. This quarter we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan. And the Board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion. Moving onto page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year on year. Average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 23% driven by mortgage and auto, but with continued strength across all products. And we had record business banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year on year, and with a strong pipeline, up 17%. We added nearly 2 million households year on year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong acquisition trends including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among US banks, up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items which contributed a little under $200 million. Principally a one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of high quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was up, but flat if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned, with gross in card and auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitments, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. Finally, credit trends across the consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in card trending up slightly. Over the last two, three years we have responsibly expanded our credit box in card in the prime and near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate and performances in line with our expectations. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly, and as such we built $250 million of reserves this quarter. Moving to auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry, and with a very sharp focus on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations, and we built $50 million in reserves this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against these reserve builds we saw releases of $125 million, principally driven by mortgage. Turning to page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion, and an ROE of 15%. In banking IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked Number One in global IBCs, ranking Number One in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter we ranked Number Two globally and grew share by 50 basis points. In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank Number One globally, growing share by 30 basis points, and we ranked Number One in every product category for the first half of this year. [Debt] underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with a market which was down 4%. And we ranked Number Two globally. Moving onto the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM, as the new issuance market continues to improve. And we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high grade bond issuance offset by lower acquisition finance. Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year on year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. Fixed income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging markets on higher client flows. And performance also improved in credit and securitized products, as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment driving increased primary and secondary market activity. Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by a reserve build for oil and gas. And finally expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year on year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%. Moving onto page 6 and Commercial Banking. Overall a solid quarter for Commercial Banking with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion, and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year on year. And we continued to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan balances up 13% year on year. Commercial real estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. And C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and middle market. Revenue was up 4% year on year driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth. And expense of $731 million was up 4%, reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by oil and gas but almost fully reserved. And outside of energy credit performance continues to be strong. Moving onto page 7 and Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $521 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year on year as we continue to feel the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year on year, largely driven by lower legal expense, and recall that the prior year included a non-core loss. AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year on year, respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows into our fixed income products, with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remained good, with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by mortgage, up 20%. Turning to page 8 and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included two notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter offset by a number of tax items, including additions to tax reserves for developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted it would have been closer to 36%. Now turning to page 9 and moving onto the outlook. To reiterate, our Firm-wide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. To wrap up. A strong quarter reflecting our leadership positions and the benefits of our diversified franchise, with the consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in markets, continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment. And just before I open up to Q&A, just for those of you on the phone, Jamie is here. He has a very hoarse voice, so we'll try and use it sparingly. If you hear him croaky, that's why. Operator, open up the line, please. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Brian.
MARIANNE LAKE: Brian, I know that everybody is keenly interested to hear what we have to say, but the truth of the matter is it's very, very early days. The new government is just forming as we speak. Negotiations need to be given some time to unfold and take shape. So it's really too early to hypothesize. We would hope that we can continue to operate the way we are right now. But we will just continue to evaluate the landscape, as I'm sure you will, over the coming weeks, months and quarters, and plan accordingly. The most important thing is that we intend to continue to support our European franchise and clients throughout.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, on the card space, as you know, we have loans running off. We're replacing them all of the time. Over the course of the last couple years, since the end of 2013, we made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully. And we've been monitoring them very closely. And what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations. And these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. So, the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So, nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectations for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to Auto, not to speak for others, but obviously when you look at lower FICO scores and high LTVs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. And not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination -- very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember, for Auto this year, I think the charge-off rate's going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. We're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will ultimately come down, and we're being thoughtful about that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Jim.
MARIANNE LAKE: At the risk of not getting like overly complicated, the long-term debt expense -- our NII was flat with loan growth. And NII on loan growth being offset by long-term debt expense, which was largely to do with the hedging of non-dollar debt and just relative quarter-over-quarter small moves in currency levels and currency basis. So, I would honestly characterize it, not to sort of underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat. You have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. So, NIM just naturally is down a few basis points. But we would be looking for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter, and for our NIM to be relatively stable.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, I would say there's going to be two things. First of all, obviously when you talk about Consumer, it kind of gets dwarfed by Card. So let's start with Card. We are growing the portfolio. We added 4% core loans year over year in Card. So naturally, as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves. So there will be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then, as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates at circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly. So there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons. And similarly, volume-wise in Auto we should see some adds, but again, in comparison to Card, modest.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, as you know, Erika, everything that we do, we do with a view to, first of all, the client franchise and making sure that we're supporting our clients. And then secondarily, with a view to all of our binding constraints. We will provide capital and access to the CIB. But also take into consideration our overall objective of making sure that we stay in the 3.5% G-SIB bucket. So we will continue to try and find capacity to be able to recycle it and grow high-ROE/high-ROA business.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not anything significant, no. I think you've got to compare it to the prior year, which was stronger, particularly this time last year in Asia. And that's less true today -- stronger in Europe, less strong in Asia. It's more of a regional story than any particularly significant items.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Betsy.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So let me -- two pieces to the story. Yes, the guidance is $2 billion-plus year on year. You'll recall when we came in to Investor Day, we said we would expect $2 billion, rates flat. It looks like rates will be flat, at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year. You've seen already in the first two quarters that year over year we're up $1.4 billion. We were doing better than that on a combination of lower deposit bases reprices and also on strong loan growth. But if you annualize that, that would be too high. We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower 10-year. It's not significant. But it will offset that to a degree. We would expect our NII to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion up year on year -- largely strong loan growth, low reprice.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say we've been doing a combination. We've been growing our deposits more strongly than the industry. So we continue to be net-net attracting more deposits than the industry, and also, as you say, a mix shift out of securities and into loans. Our outlook for loan growth through the remainder of the year is to be at the higher end of our range. We said 10% to 15% core loan growth, and at this point, demand still seems robust. So we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. We certainly have been this quarter. So at this point I would say that it's a combination of factors. And remember that the way we think about our investment securities portfolio also takes into consideration how we think about positioning the Firm's duration of equities. So all of those factors will contribute.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Glenn.
MARIANNE LAKE: If I get this wrong, I apologize. But I think it was actually we make $3.5 billion on the rates implied and $6 billion on normalized rates. But in any case, let me just talk about rates flat versus implied right now. And just because things can change so quickly, let's just focus on 2017. Rates flat from here. So, with the 10-year at about 1.5% and IOER at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth, notwithstanding any sort of long-end pressure, we would still expect year over year our NII next year to be up between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, implied, which is actually not that much different from that. So it does have about 20 basis points better long-end rates by the end of 2017, but otherwise relatively flat through the end of 2017 would be about $0.5 billion more than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Growing like a sunflower, not like a weed.
MARIANNE LAKE: Look, I'll say a couple of things. The first is, a lot of that growth is commercial term lending. And it is the case that we have the technology and a process that has speed and certainty of execution, and competitive funding costs. So it is the case that it's a value proposition that we're able to bring to clients, I think, that differentiates us. We're able to close in times that are a fraction of what the industry is. Secondarily, we're really concentrated on identified, supply-constrained markets, low-rent stabilized. So these are not the same properties that had problems in the past. We have -- since the previous cycle, we have looked carefully at our underwriting, and there are some things and some regions and some products that we either don't do or do significantly less of. So we're very, very careful. But we're looking at some really good credit quality in our commercial real estate portfolio right now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Matt.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say in the CIB, it's also a revenue story. So you need to consider both factors (multiple speakers). So let me talk about where we are on the expense commitments. And you'll recall that -- whether you remember a $4.8 billion number or a $5.5 billion number in total, we're about 70% of the way through delivering against that across the CIB and the CCB at the end of the second quarter, and we continue to make progress. In the CCB, obviously, it is generally more progressive. And in the CIB, it's a bit more about technology and operations, and it takes some time to deliver that. But fundamentally we continue to chug through that. And we will get there over the course of the next several quarters. So I would say in line with our expectations, and is a contributing factor.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say the comp-to-revenue ratio is an outcome, just for what it's worth. Obviously we try to give the range to give people an idea. We pay competitively and we pay for risk-adjusted performance. But there's nothing notable going on. We've been actually at the lower end of our range for a little while now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning, Mike.
MARIANNE LAKE: So it's always a little tricky. The share thing is going to become clearer with a rear-view mirror than it is necessarily at a moment in time. It does feel like we are doing fairly well competitively, not just against European banks, but just generally. And not just in Europe, but generally, because we, as you say, have continued to be there for clients across products, across the globe. So I would say that we feel like we are doing fairly well. We'll know whether that is share gains when we are able to actually look at that in the rear-view mirror. But there's still plenty of competition out there. So we're just focused on serving our clients the right way. But it does feel a little bit like we're doing well.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE: I'm going to try to tell you as best I can, if you can hear me. So, number one, we do think it will reduce the GDP, the UK and the EU, a little bit. And obviously that's not going to affect our business plans. That will affect the economies a little bit. Number two, we know it's going to create uncertainty for an extended time period. So we don't think we can answer or make certain all these things you want to know because there are a lot of parties involved. We are hoping that the political leaders are very sensible. It makes sense for both the EU and for Britain to think through the process to make it sensible, whatever changes they make, to give businesses time. I'm talking about years -time to adjust to the new reality, which we don't know what it is. I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients day in and day out. If it adds extra cost, so be it. I'm not really worried about it. It would be nice if it doesn't create huge turmoil. I'm hoping the EU is sensible, but we're going to be prepared. As Marianne mentioned, there's a range of outcomes. Any one (inaudible) we'll try to be prepared for each one of them. We're not going to, like, pull back on serving people in Italy, Germany, France, UK or Spain because it might lead to higher costs. I would accept the higher cost, as opposed to disrupt our clients.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would also point out, Mike, that competitively we are not in this situation alone. And so we're going to take our time to work out what the right course of action is. And obviously we'll update you as and when that becomes clearer. We're not going to be at a competitive disadvantage. If anything, as we talked about earlier, we feel like we're in a position of strength.
MARIANNE LAKE: The truth of the matter is, it's a bit early to say for that, too. I hate to continue to repeat that. I will tell you that, generally speaking, uncertainty is not particularly conducive or constructive for M&A. But in this case, I think there are some offsets. So I would start with, in terms of the actual strategic dialogue with CEOs and at the boardrooms, it is as good as it's ever been. If you think about the other factors that would be supportive of M&A, like cheap financing globally, low organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the US and globally notwithstanding a bit of the steam taken out in Europe or the UK, all of that should continue to be supportive for strategic M&A. At the end of the day -- and currency could be supportive of cross-border activities. So there are puts and takes. I'm certain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. At the end of the day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases. And similarly, volatility, generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM, but investor appetite is still there, and there have been deals priced post-Brexit. It's a little early. There's still activity. Volatility is reasonably subdued at this point. And I think, because there are no event calendars out there right now, there's still quite a lot of opportunity in the space. Obviously, DCM, low rates would be a tailwind, notwithstanding the M&A and ECM landscape.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I'm going to start with the second part of the question. So we are still very much concentrated in the prime and near-prime space, but we have a higher percentage of our origination in the near-prime space, reasonably meaningfully higher over the course of the last couple years. So where we may have previously been, I think 40%, above 760. Now that's less than that, and there's more like 20% or 30% below 700. By the end of the day, still pristine credit, relatively speaking. With respect to delinquencies, is it a cure rate issue? Not specifically, no.
MARIANNE LAKE: We're not really doing much in the way of 2017 guidance right now. It will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers. I think we're at a very good run rate of investments. We've increased reasonably significantly in terms of marketing dollars and also lease growth. That will drive profitability in the medium to longer term. So it's possible, if we see the opportunity to continue to do that, we would do it. But we have no specific guidance yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: Revenue environment can change reasonably quickly, particularly, as you know, with rates, and to a lesser degree, markets. We're not going to overreact to a short-term phenomenon.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, taxes much -- generally speaking, the reserve changes are somewhat episodic. Outside of those, yes, 36% is a good central case for our managed tax rate.
MARIANNE LAKE: Good morning.
MARIANNE LAKE: So starting with the qualification that obviously, as you suggested, it's going to be market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave the guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower. So here's what I would say -- first half, market challenged; second half, markets better. Net-net, first quarter markets challenged; second quarter better. Net-net, first half relatively flat year over year. So, call it a wash, with the acknowledgement that we knew we would expect seasonal declines in the second half of the year. Mortgage better -- so you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year on year, actually by a reasonably significant amount. Given obviously where the rate environment is, as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. And against that, to your point, lower IB fees and lower Asset Management revenues, given the environment. The way I would characterize it is there are puts and takes, but net-net it's still a reasonable central case. So we are not changing it. But it's market dependent.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say if you look at the last three years of PPNR, notwithstanding that there have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 CCAR results, so not this year's but last year's, were low. Not to say that means that these results are more normal. I would say if you look at the three years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks, revenue generation we would expect. And you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. So I don't have insights that I can share with you specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year on year, nor do we really try to do that. You're right -- operational risk is likely a piece of it. And that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say, there can be volatility but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think the PPNR would start, and it's consistent as you can see, relatively speaking with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now, where we've said using the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply a CET1 ratio would need to be to pass, it had previously been a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and, therefore, the improved result, at this point, it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context, as we sort of look forward, sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the sort of 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form hopefully, it will alleviate to a degree a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest to you, as we said at Investor Day, that CCAR may, depending on how the G-SIB surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding, if not likely will become binding. And so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward. And we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have.
MARIANNE LAKE: We think about using all of our channels based upon obviously the demand, and our capacity and our appetite to want to continue to close strongly for our customers. We've obviously also been focused in the anticipation of it becoming a more purchase-oriented market very much on building out the retail channel and the retail distribution channel, and that's been very successful. So there's less correspondent contribution this quarter. It is a lever we will likely use going forward.
MARIANNE LAKE: At this point, I'd still say -- at this point, we would still say it will be episodic. And while we are hopeful that the overall structural costs will start coming down, or has come down, and that's a good thing, there will still be potentially some puts and takes in the legal space. There's no real way obviously of forecasting a run rate. I would just do what many of you have done, I think, and go back and look at what the legal expense looked like in the years preceding the crisis, and make your own determination whether it's going to be structurally a little higher. But it probably wouldn't be multiples of that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi, Ken.
MARIANNE LAKE: Okay. So it was particularly strong in rates, but nevertheless also very strong year over year in currencies, emerging markets, credit trading, [SPG]. So it was pretty broad-based. But remember, you also have to think about it relative to the equivalent course of last year, and we didn't have a particularly strong second quarter last year. So on a relative basis, that is an important factor, but it was pretty broad-based -- more volume than anything. And then seasonality, I'm sorry -- look, it's anyone's guess. I think you can go back and look over time. But last year we saw -- we had a weak second quarter, as I said. So we didn't see as much seasonality. But if you look at the last quarter's run rate, I don't know that would be a bad place to start -- last year's third quarter run rate would not be a bad place to start.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'm going to start with a couple of general comments, which is, we talked about the fact that the charge-offs that we've experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. So we're at the point now where at least as a sort of basic matter as we're experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we're in a reasonably good reserve position, notwithstanding that idiosyncratically there may be additional adds. What we would need to see is continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital markets to allow companies to repair their balance sheets, and continued stabilization if not improvement in oil and gas prices. And so everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. And yes, we are growing our portfolio. And so even if it were not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves, but there are also time to (inaudible) pay down -- a lot of puts and takes, too.
MARIANNE LAKE: So, I mean, just to say -- we obviously have our own spend data to look at, and it continues -the Card spend is up 8% year on year. Energy continues to be a tailwind for consumers. The labor market continues to be solid and improving. And sentiment is still good. Housing, still improving. So I mean, really just looking at the same things you're looking at, and we obviously have a slightly different lens to it. But all other things equal, consumers are in very good shape, and demand is there for the product. And we've been investing outside of consumer in new products -- inside Consumer, sorry -- in the Freedom Unlimited space and also in marketing. We're growing, not only because the demand is there but also because we're investing.
MARIANNE LAKE: Our second-quarter results reflect everything that we have and we know of at the end of the quarter. And we're not going to make any specific comments on regulatory exams.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not specifically. I'm not sure; I haven't polled the dealers myself. We continue to have very high FICO scores. I'm not aware of that, but I can't comment.
MARIANNE LAKE: In our portfolio at this point, no.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we are expecting refi to be stronger in the coming quarters; and the mortgage market, as best we can tell, will be at around $1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion this year.
MARIANNE LAKE: So we've done one, and we're looking at more securitizations in the mortgage space. And we are keeping a vertical stripe. We're retaining the loans on our balance sheet -- or the securities on our balance sheet, I should say. And in doing that we've been able to get private capital to take the majority of the lower credit risk and get better capital treatment for ourselves, in terms of the RWA that it attracts.
MARIANNE LAKE: New originations.
MARIANNE LAKE: I'll just start by sort of orientating you on why that would be the impact for us. If you look at our balance sheet and you look at what we have in fixed rate loans versus what we have in either IOER or in LIBOR loans, it's about $650 billion. So we're much more sensitive to the front end of the rate curve. If you look at our earnings at risk disclosures, a 100-basis-point parallel shift would be around $800 million. And so obviously we haven't seen, and won't hopefully see, anything of that order of magnitude. That kind of gives you an ability to size up, notwithstanding compounding, why you've only seen our NII relative to prior expectations come down by that much.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I think earlier on the call somebody else asked the question, and I made the comment that it's really more related to the results from our hedges of non-dollar debt, long-term debt. And so in the first quarter, the dollar weakened. In the second quarter, it strengthened. And with some currency basis in the first quarter that we didn't see in the second quarter, it really is, not to dismiss it, but it really is accounting and nothing really else than that.
MARIANNE LAKE: No shift from our desire to want to be with engaged customers and our rewards programs. Our products are all geared towards that. So it's really just a credit decision. And, yes, we do have relationships with many, many customers in that still near-prime space.
MARIANNE LAKE: Hi.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So look, obviously P2P real-time payments is very important to our customers, so therefore it's important to us. It's also important for us on the industry that it's done in a safe and secure way. And so early warning, the fraud protection that they are able to provide, as well as bank-level cyber security and the absence of a need to provide your bank credentials we think is very strongly positive for our customers. And we expect to see volume go across that. As you know, we have QuickPay already, and we saw reasonably significant volume, $21 billion, on QuickPay last year and growing. So I would expect to see more and more P2P payments. And it's good for our customers, it's good for us.
JAMIE DIMON: If you look at the whole payment space, Chase Paymentech is gaining share. Chase Net is doing very well. Chase Pay, we've signed up lots of different people. One piece of that is the P2P. Today, right now, if you use Chase QuickPay, it's very easy within Chase to Chase. It's now just as easy to go from Chase to a bunch of other banks, who I won't name now. We've just started rolling out -- it's soon to be rolled out to 60% of American banking accounts. And then we're going to make it available to all banks. So you will be able to go P2P, real time, through Chase QuickPay, there will be a special app for Chase QuickPay. It'll also be branded under another name, which we haven't rolled out yet, which I think will be rolled out shortly. I think it's a great success that the banks can get together and do this. This will be great service, which I think shows you the banks making progress on what you would have called prior fintech.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, operator.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.",0.1200000000000001,-0.7230000000000021,0,0.1133234150428851,0.12916301821899995
44,Q2_2015,"
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation. It's available on our website and please, if you could, refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
MARIANNE LAKE: So to -- obviously we don't have any particular insight. I think the comments you're referring to were comments about the support for evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all [of it]. And so really it hasn't changed relative to previous comments and the door has clearly been left open for that, but we have no further information. And so far it's evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of the surcharge, so we're just going to have to I suppose and see. Meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, if it happens for us it would happen for everyone. We have shown you before -- not that that's a good outcome, but we've shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels. And so if everybody has to increase their minimum, it is going to be a similar position for everyone. Meanwhile, we are continuing to execute on everything that we've already told you we are going to do to optimize our capital. Our commitment is to go to firmly within the 4.5% bucket for the surcharge, and if we believe we can do it and it's economic and it's not going to hurt our clients, we may go further. So we will respond when we see the rules and we are not going to stop continuing to do the best we can to optimize our returns based on scarce resources.
MARIANNE LAKE: We actually haven't really changed our point of view since the investor day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit -- and there are other people who have slightly differing views. But we are expecting retail deposits to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition for good, high-quality, LCR-compliant retail deposits; given the advancements in mobile banking; given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates. So when we think about our sensitivity and our reprice, we model it in assumption that it's going to be higher, somewhat higher.
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Obviously, when you talk about trading, when you have two months to go in a quarter you don't know the exact number and repricing is a complex issue. I'll give you some very specific things and then I'll tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up. Clearing, we've definitely seen people start to charge for clearing and effectively charge the balance sheet 25, 50 basis points. It's a small business so I don't think it's going to dramatically affect those lines. Prime broker, we've seen similar type of thing. Repo, it seems that people are charging pretty much for repo. We need to get a return on it. Exotic derivatives, which are again very small, are being repriced to, I would say, full capital and liquidity. Muni credit has probably been repriced a little bit. Again, it's a small market. If you go to credit and trading, so credit we've really not seen any repricing effectively in commercial credit. You've seen a little bit in mortgage to make up for the extra costs in mortgage. You've seen a little bit in auto; it got more aggressive, not less aggressive. So trade finance you've seen a little bit of repricing, and I know these are not all trading numbers. What you don't see, Mike, is that in a lot of cases, while you may have repriced a little bit, you're also shedding business so that you have -- as you are protecting your margins by -- because of AML costs you are going to not do certain types of business anymore. In FHA the lifetime cost of servicing, you cut back on FHA volumes, etc. So you're protecting your margins, but you're actually shrinking your revenues in some cases. That's happening a little bit in clearing and prime broker and stuff like that; you want your best clients. In other categories clients are -- like deposits, we haven't seen repricing effectively, I don't think, in non-operating deposits. On the other hand, some clients are saying let's restructure our relationship; it makes more sense for you, JPMorgan. I'm willing to give you other business which is not credit sensitive, etc. It's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return on your capital, not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line item. It's very easy to show revenue growth.
JAMIE DIMON: Mostly what you see in trading is just volume related and spread related, etc. Even in trading, spreads are narrow but breadth is also very low, which means spreads get gap out pretty quickly, which eventually could be good for trading. So it's unclear (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: I'm talking about basis points, 20 basis points, 15 basis points, 10 basis points. That's all you need in some of these things to get an adequate return on capital as we currently look at capital.
MARIANNE LAKE: So what I said, and hopefully it was clear, is that we actually exceeded our commitment. We actually shrunk our non-operating deposits by more than $100 billion and not just through our consumer deposits, but we are also able to grow wholesale operating deposits. So we had a good mix shift both in consumer versus wholesale, but also within wholesale and so we feel really great about that. There are two priorities after that. The first is protecting that position and making sure that we are able to not have inflows of those deposits as the industry continues to absorb them. But the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but it gets harder and harder each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned to operating accounts and operating business. And we've always said that we want to do this for the right reasons, for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that's going to materially harm our clients. So that's the lens.
JAMIE DIMON: The [product] has also been made in the Level III assets: derivative receivables, certain balance sheet items, RWA. So the effort to optimize the balance sheet for G-SIFI, etc., is not going to stop; that we are going to continue to do.
MARIANNE LAKE: But you know what, I don't anticipate us launching another and announcing another program. We've already done a little better. We will continue to try and do a little better. In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now, as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis that on an average basis. But the equation looking forward will be much the same math we said at investor day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for a half a year, but there would be some expense benefits on FDIC costs, etc. So not a very big number. I think that was the question?
MARIANNE LAKE: A little bit, yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so let me do this in two parts, and I'm going to start with the consumer businesses, where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well, well on our way to delivering against that -- the commitment $2 billion dollars in 2017 versus 2014. It's not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time. And if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion. So that gives you a sense for how we are tracking. On the CIB, obviously the commitment is somewhat newer; at investor day this year $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014. I would characterize that in two parts. $1.5 billion is business simplification. The majority of business simplification -- not all, but the majority -- will come out of our run rate in 2015. And you've already seen that in the first and second quarter when you've seen the $300 million, $400 million expense reductions in each of the quarters on business simplification. The other $1.3 billion, which is all the reductions in technology and operations and headcount, is going to be things. We are working on it actively -- we have programs, we have people -- but it's going to be more of a 2016 and 2017 benefit. If I was to look at the first half of 2015 versus the first half of 2014, take the $500 billion in consumer and business simplification in the CIB space -- that's probably the right way to size it, about a quarter so far this year.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: RWA, advance RWA is down $36 billion, $37 billion; [one five three six]. We said a little greater than $1.5 trillion. We are still on track to be $1.5 trillion or a little greater, $1.5 trillion advanced at the end of the year. Standardized right now is at $1.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion, so pretty close to $1.5 trillion against the target at the end of the year of $1.55 trillion. That's a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have some upward pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that we are growing. If you look to our investor day targets, we are still hoping to maintain the discipline around both of those at approximately $1.5 trillion through time.
MARIANNE LAKE: Of course. I'll do it in three parts. First of all, it is growing pretty solidly or strongly, so either in-line or in many cases better than the industry across most of the product categories. The one that's growing the most strongly because of the way we are portfolioing loans is mortgage, so that's driving some of that outperformance. And the one that is most challenging, but still growing, is middle market. Fiercely competitive; everybody is chasing that sector. But you can go through the businesses. We had 6% loan growth, 8% loan and lease growth in auto; 6% business banking; 19% core in consumer; 4% in commercial, so 3% core in card. So it's solid to strong pretty much across the board; most competitive in middle-market and flattered by portfolio and mortgages.
MARIANNE LAKE: What I said earlier is not inconsistent; it's entirely consistent with what we said last quarter. We built reserves modestly for oil and gas last quarter on the back of the spring redetermination of borrowing base. We feel another modest reserve this quarter. And we said we don't -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year. There's another redetermination cycle in the fall and it's I'm not going to say likely, but it's possible we will be selectively downgrading some clients. If none of that is out of our expectations, it's completely normal levels considering the cycle and how we think about the credits, we are still very happy. And we are not going to make any comments on regulators.
JAMIE DIMON: Those reserves do not mean we're going to have losses.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct. We are reserving for downgrades; doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to be cash losses.
MARIANNE LAKE: So credit, like charge-offs, have been very benign across the whole sales base. They have reverted to somewhat more normal levels in auto, so I'm not expecting there to be a big step changes in the underlying charge-offs in the wholesale space. We continue to see improvements at a slower pace in mortgage, but at 21 basis points we are sort of getting down there. And card, while it is slightly above -- 2.6% above our 2.5% is also pretty much getting there. It's one of the reasons why we've said expect the second half to look like the first half in terms of order of magnitude and expect net-net low for long.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say in the non-credit -- sorry, just to clarify the comment on oil and gas; we said they will not necessarily translate into losses. We are not going to predict which ones will or won't. On the reserves, for non-credit-impaired portfolio we are continuing to see improvements in charge-offs as well as home prices, albeit a little bit more gradually. So I would still expect there to be more reserve releases over the course of the next 18 months in hundreds of millions of dollars in total; not billions any longer, of course. We have $1.8 billion reserved right now. In the post-credit-impaired space clearly that's life-of-loan model and so we will continue to evaluate that model against parameters that we have in it and expectations, so that will be what it is at the time. And in card we're not expecting any significant reserve actions.
MARIANNE LAKE: So you are absolutely right; all the underlying phenomenon are still there. We are still seeing spread compression, but we are seeing very strong growth in spend. We aren't quite lapped yet on new accounts going through the revenue rate. We will eventually be, but it's a good thing to be adding these new accounts that will drive strong spend in the future. So I would say our near-term guidance is that we are expecting our revenue rate to be at the lower end of that 12%, 12.5% range. And, yes, over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships we would expect that to start to edge up.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. We told you we would hope to drive core loan growth in the card space low single digits and this quarter it was 3%.
JAMIE DIMON: I just want to emphasize -- Marianne mentioned it, but emphasize; Chase Paymentech, which is seeing really good growth, probably 50% faster than the industry, but we are also signing people with Chase Paymentech combined with ChaseNet. We are running real volume across it and we are signing up a lot of folks for that and ChasePay. So the strategy of ours is kind of coming to fruition and we hope it will be a good driver; happy customers and good growth for the next 10 years.
MARIANNE LAKE: Obviously we don't give you lots of details on our issuance plans. You are right; one of the drivers for us to issue in part, not exclusively, was it's not -- as you know, we were Tier 1 leverage constrained in CCAR and so as a result of issuing this we not only helped TLAP, but we help our CCAR stress capacity. And we are about 164 RWA. So we are not going to talk about forward issuance but we've made progress.
MARIANNE LAKE: So to start with Volcker, we aren't expecting Volcker to have an impact in the near-term trading outlook. We've been talking very consistently over an extended period of time about the fact that we've reshaped our business through time to be compliant in substance and in form with Volcker. And so while that was real reshaping of the business, the last 18 months have been really focused on getting operationally ready around the reporting and the metrics; it's been hard work and we are ready. So I don't expect it to have a direct impact on our near-term trading. Clearly over time we need to continue to evolve the feedback loop with regulators, but that will be entirely gradual. With respect to the trading, it is too early for us to say anything specific about the second quarter -- sorry, the third quarter -- except to say we are -- all other things equal, we would expect to see normal seasonality from the market. Nothing has changed that fundamentally wouldn't have us expecting normal seasonality in the third quarter.
JAMIE DIMON: I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time, has been -- we've become very consistent. I think in 2014 we had no trading loss days and even this year there were only a handful of trading loss days. Obviously some areas are up and some are down, but our shares are high. I think we are doing a great job servicing clients. We are adopting all the new rules. Like [50%] of interest-rate swaps are on SEF today and I think it's 95% of FX trading by transaction is electronic. You can do a lot on your mobile phone or iPad now, so the business is actually doing fine. The returns on risk are very good. We used to report that, but kind of return on VAR are very good. It's become a much more stable business that clients need overtime.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. And just to add to that, I would say that we also talked about, in the period of transition towards a more normal economy and rising rates, you might see some shocks like this. We've weathered both the EMEA bond sell off and China well, and it just speaks to the strength of our risk management discipline. And we generally do pretty well in more difficult markets.
MARIANNE LAKE: So with respect to -- we saw a stronger seasonal purchase market. We actually gained a little share in the purchase market in the quarter and refi held up pretty well because of pipelines coming into the quarter. But we are expecting that to grow seasonally in purchase and in refi to pull that down to smaller levels in the third seasonally. And no direct impact from the disclosure requirements.
JAMIE DIMON: Part of the quarter is the reserve takedown, so don't double count that. That may not be there next quarter.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right.
MARIANNE LAKE: The way I would think about it is normal tax rate for the year is 30%, plus or minus. Just given the way tax reserving is it's usually biased to being fairly conservative and so, as you know, we have seen discrete tax gains periodically, some of them not insignificant, resulting from completion of settlements and audits with tax authorities. Not to say that you should necessarily model in directly 30%, but we don't predict or forecast the tax benefits.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's definitely the latter and I think it's perhaps a little too early to tell on the former.
JAMIE DIMON: Jumbo.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes. So over half are jumbo, the other are conventional performing fee plus.
MARIANNE LAKE: We have a fairly large securities portfolio and our decisions around that are in part driven by our overall interest-rate risk positioning, but with respect to the mortgages it's fundamentally a better execution decision for us. We will portfolio or loan where it makes economic sense to do it relative to distributing it, other than jumbo where, clearly, they will always go on our balance sheet.
JAMIE DIMON: If you can put a jumbo on a higher ROE than a Fannie/Freddie, you would do that. And part of the investment portfolio is for liquidity and obviously, because non-operating deposits are down, proportions of that will come down too.
MARIANNE LAKE: There's been a lot of press and reports, including recently, on market liquidity and there are a number of factors playing into it. It's true that liquidity, in some cases, has dried up quite quickly when there's been extreme volatility and it fed on itself. But the reality is that we've talked about the fact that that was likely to be a phenomenon that happened more frequently as we transition to a more normal environment. We are very disciplined about how we trade and support our clients and generally we've been able to weather them very well, as has generally the community. Not that we know, but we haven't got any stories or horror stories around (inaudible) a bond sell-off or other things this quarter. So I think it's definitely an issue; one that we need to watch, one that has multiple root causes, and one that we are generally taking in our stride.
JAMIE DIMON: And look at the big picture and we pointed it out, the financial system -- like in the United States banks are much more sound. Trading books have more capital liquidity. The whole system is better off. So you can't look at one piece and say what will that do. The second is that these -- obviously there's less liquidity in the marketplace and it's a whole bunch of factors. It's hard to tease out exactly which one, but trading books have more capital and more liquidity. I think people are a little worried about potential Volcker rule violations, so they are being a little more cautious. There are obviously structural changes in electronic trading, HFT, and each business is slightly different. So not every -- I wouldn't say everyone is affected exactly the same. It's also true that the system is pretty resilient to what happened with the currencies and treasury, and that's a good sign. I think what we are going to be really cautious about is when markets aren't that good. JPMorgan is fine. We are not talking about whether or not JPMorgan is going to have a hard time with liquidity. We are not. The question I really would have is, when markets are tough, will there be a feedback from -- these violent markets, will there be more volume or less volume. Someone was quoted the other day saying markets always pull back when there are tough times; that is true. The question is will be harder and worse, will it feed back into the real economy. It's not will there be lack of liquidity. During the crisis they were two market makers out there and we were one of them and so you need them a little bit, but it doesn't stop markets from gapping out. We are not saying this is a terrible thing, just being very cautious about it. And we are always trying to be very cautious.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I can tell you that obviously we took the feedback from the regulators as the industry did exactly as you would expect, entirely seriously; put loads of resources and effort to bear in making as much progress as we thought was humanly possible over the course of the period. And we feel that we made very, very -- I would agree with you; the industry, but JPMorgan specifically, made very, very significant progress in addressing the feedback between getting it and the July submission date. And obviously we feel like we have a credible plan. That's not to say that we won't continue and some of our plans, and you saw it in some other disclosures. We are going to continue to work very hard at simplifying our legal entity structure over the next few years and interconnectedness and operational resiliency and all the things -- and reporting readiness, all the things that are going to make it even better. So we think we made very, very significant progress. We think our plan is credible. We don't know exactly when we will get feedback, probably in the fall.
JAMIE DIMON: And we respond to every single thing regulators raise with the huge resources to meet their needs. It will probably be iterative over time about they'll make more demands this year, etc. and --. By the way, I think there is a 50-page public part that you can actually read and it shows you. That's a 50-page summary of I think a 200,000 page detailed report.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's very broadly competitive and we compete obviously with big banks, regional banks, and non-banks. It's not that we are losing loans and deals most often on price. It's normally on size of holds or non-bank taking whole deals or on structures, but it's very, very competitive. Everybody likes the sector for growth and everybody likes -- so everybody is trying to make progress. We are being very, very disciplined, and as a result of that, slightly lower growth than the industry average. And you might not always want us to always grow at the industry average. You want us to hold true to discipline.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, we looked at the whole relationship. I forgot the exact number, but if you look at the middle market relationship, I think something like half, maybe even a little bit less, of the revenues are from the lending.
MARIANNE LAKE: The way I would characterize it is we had a period of time following the Wampum merger where we were in new markets and we didn't have the right distribution footprint where we were building. We said about a year and a half ago that we felt like we had the right footprint as a macro matter, about 5,600, and that now we are around perfecting that, which is about consolidating certain branches where it makes sense but building new ones where makes sense. Consolidating them together where it makes sense. You will see I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and that's probably still the right way to look at it, but it's really perfecting the network. Moving branches to the areas we like
JAMIE DIMON: One add is that we are thinking about attacking a new city for the first time, like in a major way, because we want to see how that works out.
MARIANNE LAKE: In the non-operating deposits within the wholesale deposits, the majority is the CIB, but not quite two-thirds. And then you've got the commercial bank and you've got a little bit in asset management. So it is the majority of the number, but there are still sizable numbers, particularly in the commercial bank in the financial (inaudible) space. And then, when you look at our overall balance sheet, you see cash going down because of the deposits. You see securities going down, but strong loan growth offsetting, and then small reductions in trading and secured financing.
MARIANNE LAKE: Are you doing year-over-year?
JAMIE DIMON: You're starting in the wrong time period.
MARIANNE LAKE: Are you starting at the year-end or year over year?
JAMIE DIMON: Well, we are getting more operating deposits, too.
MARIANNE LAKE: We talked about the deposit reduction is overachieving in non-op and improving mix in operating. So, trust me -- and I'm not looking at what you're looking at, so I do trust you -- but trust me that 60%-ish of it is CIB.
JAMIE DIMON: We will clarify off this line because (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: The M&A -- we don't think Greece has affected the M&A dialogue very much, because it's been very active pretty much around the world. And when I say around the world, it's also like European companies coming to America and American companies going to Europe, etc., and those conversations continue.
MARIANNE LAKE: A lot to Europe, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: A lot to Europe, yes. So Greece had no real effect on that. Greece is a very, very small percent of the Eurozone in total, so economically it's not a driving factor for most of the companies there. Psychologically maybe it's going to affect some people, but I don't see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of Greece.
MARIANNE LAKE: And would just -- with respect to the backlog, I would say it's very good.
JAMIE DIMON: We did see a tremendous amount of something that we've almost never seen before, of American companies financing in euro because it was cheaper to do that, even if you swap back to dollars. So you saw a lot of American companies going to Europe to do that.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think if you go back to last quarter, Brennan, and take a look at the remarks from last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business that drove a reduction, but just a classification issue. And then in addition we did lose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact. I think if you go back and look at the second quarter, hopefully that will make it clear. And so the guidance, when we did those -- when we made that presentational change and obviously we talked about the client exit a few quarters ago, the guidance was, given those, we would expect the revenues to run between $950 million seasonally. And this is obviously a strong season and, therefore, it at through $950 million and $1 billion seasonally and, therefore, it's at the $1 billion.
JAMIE DIMON: So Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines, which we don't normally do, on treasury services, investor services, and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong. And Sarah finds it very frustrating that you can't get it corrected quarter after quarter, so we've said here is the number that is actually our best guess. So, please, put it in your third- and fourth-quarter models. And mortgage revenue was another one which has been ongoing to us. And what's the other one so we can just get it on the table whatever it is?
JAMIE DIMON: Nancy, it's really important -- when we talk about these numbers, by the way, RWA and branches, we are not making commitments to anybody. That's our best guess knowing what we know today, but we reserve the right to change that on a moment's notice for whatever reason that makes sense for the Company and the clients. And so branches -- it is very important that you look at branches city by city until you have the right footprint. So if you remember, the old A&P which never changed its locations and it never changed sizes and it failed. Any retail business should always be adding in new communities, subtracting in some; having the branches to adjust to a new reality, whether it's getting bigger or getting smaller. In our case it's getting smaller, but again we are not getting smaller because we are guessing at this stuff. We are getting smaller because of the less need for operations and branches now. People are doing far more on mobile phones like that. So we actually do it city by city. You don't set an overall guideline and say you have to do X, Y, or Z. It's city by city. And so, for the most part, in the WaMu footprint, I think Florida and California for the most part, city by city we went in and added what we thought we should have. Wampum -- remember we also added on top of that small business, private banking, some middle-market, other businesses that WaMu wasn't even in. It was part of the expansion of those businesses, too. And so when I said a new city, I'm talking about what we've never really done -- I was talking about this way back to BankOne and the stocks when we did the merger with JPMorgan -- is going into a city de novo that we never been in. There you've got to look at how many branches you are going to open, how long is it going to take. And so we do want to do one of those and that will have nothing to do with WaMu because they are also places that WaMu wasn't.
JAMIE DIMON: No. I don't think there's been a retreat from open markets there either. Remember, we've always said about China is you got to look and plan for the long run, which we do in all businesses. McKinsey has a report that shows that they are going to have 25% or so of some of the Fortune 1000 in I think it was 10 or 12 years. Enormous growth in their companies. Their companies are going overseas. Their companies are doing more M&A. We did that one unique transaction where ChemChina bought Pirelli in Italy. Obviously, when we have a unique network, we can help a Chinese company and an Italian company at the same time, so we are building there for the long run. As a risk management tool we've always said that the way we treat that is we will be prepared for very tough times and I think it's a mistake not to grow because you're going to have tough times. I have never seen an economy that didn't have tough times. If you went back to the United States, when J.P. Morgan was building JPMorgan back in 1850 and 1860, look every single time that you panic because America had a recession there would be no JPMorgan. So we are not going to change. What we've seen with the officials in China is that they are very responsive to changes, and you can argue whether they should have gotten that involved in the stock market. You can't manipulate stock markets. But they are very responsive to lending. They've changed their reserve policies, their RMB policies, the QFII policies, the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect. Not everything they do is going to work, but they still seem very committed to more and more market reform, more and more of taking SOE -- rationalization of SOEs and taking them public, so some market discipline there. Creating more of a consumer society. And what we've always said -- and I think they have the wherewithal to meet their short-term objectives of growth, but we expect that they will have bumps in the road. We expect that and we are going to look right through that. The fact that their -- I also remember their market went from $4 trillion value -- so it's a $10 trillion economy. It went from $4 trillion market value to $10 trillion; now it's back to $6 trillion. I think those are the numbers. The American stock market has done that roundtrip a couple times itself and so the American economy is $18 trillion. I think our stock market is $25 trillion, so there will still be huge opportunities there. If they ever completely reverse what they are talking about doing, you will see it in far more significant ways than them getting involved in the stock market.
JAMIE DIMON: Marianne, you showed a NIM thing that NIM would go back to 265 to 275. And, remember, when we say deposit beta it is by product, by --and it's got gamma, so the first 25 basis points, the second are a different 25 basis points, they are different than the third 25 basis points. It's a pretty intensive analysis to try to get accurate; that's what we're trying to do. And it's all in that number that was presented and we don't think that's changed dramatically. As Marianne said, we are assuming that whatever happened in the last cycle, this one will be worse. In other words, you will gather less of the benefit from rates going up than we have in the past.
JAMIE DIMON: Listen, there's a unique --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, (multiple speakers).
JAMIE DIMON: It is a unique circumstance when you're at zero. There are a lot of things that happen when rates grow to 25 basis points that there will be -- you will pass very little of that also. And we also see that -- we will see that in money market funds. We will see that in some forms of deposits, etc. The beta gets much higher as rates go up. If I had to guess, I would say we are conservative, not aggressive.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, the credit downgrades included oil and gas and we called it out just because in total oil and gas was $140 million of our total net $250 million reserve build. But also I said that there were select names, it's like a dozen names, so it's not really like there's another sector, just very discrete names.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we are not going to give you that. We disclose -- when you say mortgage duration, obviously we build into all of our models mortgage duration. You guys can calculate that yourself by looking at disclosures in the 10-K that show mortgages at 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, etc. And obviously we can change that at will with our investment portfolio and things like that. It's all in the NIM already. So obviously we have negative convexity in our portfolio.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you, everyone.
JAMIE DIMON: Wait. Before you all go, I just want to tell you one of these days I'm not going to come in on this call. I'm not doing it because I want to avoid it; I don't like it. And obviously, if anything is important or really bad, I'm not going to ever try to avoid bad news here because we like to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, the good, bad, and ugly. But Marianne has started to do such a good job that I've become unnecessary to be in all of them and I can obviously go do other things. So don't be surprised if one of these days I don't show up; don't read anything into it. Thank you for being here.",0.10000000000000007,-0.37400000000000094,0,0.1002178223957365,0.10748458968567666
45,Q2_2014,"
JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: So this is Jamie and I am going to start if you don't mind. I know some of you have many questions on my recent cancer diagnosis so I would like to make a few comments on that so we can then hopefully focus on the reason for our call which is our quarterly earnings and the results of the Company. First, I want to thank everybody for their calls, their notes, their good wishes. It does mean a lot to me and my family. To start with, I feel great. I think I have some of the best doctors in the world and I will be receiving the best treatment. I am very fortunate that this is curable. To recap, we have already talked about and what my doctors have told me about, we caught it early, it is confined to the original site in the adjacent lymph nodes in the right side of my neck. It is isolated to that specific area. The cancer has not spread. Importantly, with all the tests they have done there is no evidence of cancer anywhere else in my body and it is curable with radiation and chemotherapy which I would put down as fairly standard for this kind of cancer and the prognosis is excellent. The Board will be fully briefed on my condition and if they and I feel that it is necessary to make additional disclosures we will do that but I really do think the next disclosure I am going to make will be in about seven or eight weeks saying the therapy is over, I am feeling better and the prognosis is excellent. My doctors have finalized their treatment plans with me over the last several days though I do plan as I go through treatment to be actively involved in managing our business. I've also been told that after the seven-week treatment period I have been advised to take rest, that does not mean that I won't work, they just simply say that rest and recuperation should come before other things which by the way is the exact same advice I give my friends, my family and anyone working at JPMorgan or any one of you who came down with something like this. So I do plan to work. I do plan to read. I will be accessible. Succession planning, that is why it is here, is exactly as it was before. There is no change whatsoever. The Board has plans in place and they talk about all the time for various scenarios and we are fortunate enough to have an exceptional group of executives. You know them all. I hope you take the time to tell some of the reporters the quality -- I was told people there is a book in every body and the book on a lot of the management team here is brains, ethics, work ethic, partnering, knowledge, experience, high-quality people and I actually think that many of them could run a major financial company and my Board feels the same way. Importantly the Board has been fully engaged with the senior leaders the whole time they have been at this Company. I also want to point out that we have a standing protocol in place before this, during this, and after this. We think it is simply good governance that if I am unreachable for any reason -- remember I took a three-week trip to Asia. So if for a minute, an hour, a day or a week that they are to contact our lead director who will get them the consent, the advice and a help that they need so that the Company continues to go on as usual. So I will stop there and hand it off to Marianne who will take you through the earnings of the Company.
MARIANNE LAKE, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Okay, thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting then on page 1, the firm delivered strong performance this quarter with net income of $6 billion on revenues of over $25 billion; EPS of $1.46 and a return on tangible common equity of over 14%. The reported results as you can see on the page includes approximately $670 million of firmwide legal expense. In addition to that item, there were a number of other smaller items, some positive, some negative in the results, most notably $350 million of consumer reserve releases. And we estimate our core performance for the quarter was also $6 billion plus or minus which is among the best we have ever had which is a very good result especially given the challenging environment for markets and mortgage which persisted during the second quarter and interest rates remaining low and the cost of control high. Importantly in the firm's performance this quarter, we are releasing the benefit of our diversified earnings profile as well as the focus on investing and growing the underlying performance drivers in each of our businesses which has translated into net income growth and operating leverage in a number of businesses most notably CBB, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. We also continued to make significant progress against our capital targets with a CET1 ratio of 9.8%, firmwide and bank supplementary leverage ratios of 5.4% and 5.6% respectively, and remaining compliant with liquidity requirements all while returning $3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter with gross share repurchases of $1.5 billion. Core loan growth was strong for the quarter at 4% and 8% up year on year with encouraging signs across our businesses. And NII was up slightly this quarter on a relatively flat core NIM. Turning to page 2, before getting into each of the businesses, a couple of comments here. You can see circled the adjusted expense for the quarter was $14.8 billion for an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%. This number does obviously exclude legal expense but of note, it includes a little less than $300 million of expenses related to business simplification which we consider to be non-core. Including lower incentive compensation on lower CIB revenues for the first half, we have updated our adjusted full-year expense guidance to be $58 billion plus or minus with a caveat that obviously the final number will depend on performance-related compensation for the full year. We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses and operating as efficiently as possible across our businesses. You can also see on the page the returns generated this quarter by each of our businesses which is driving strong performance of the firm overall. Moving on to page 3, as I said, the firm reported a CET1 ratio of 9.8%, up from 9.6% last quarter as we increased our common equity Tier 1 capital base by over $4 billion principally through net retained earnings. Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat in the quarter with higher operational risk RWA and some growth largely offset by lower market and credit risk RWA reflecting increased model usage and portfolio runoff. We are still on track to reach 10% plus CET1 ratio by the end of the year as previously guided. The lower of our two transitional measures and you will recall we exited Basel III Parallel at the beginning of the quarter so the lower of our two transitional measures which is technically the measure effective this quarter under the common floor is the Basel III Advanced transitional ratio which is also at 9.8%. And what isn't on the page but for your information, the fully phased in standardized ratio is 10.1%. We continue to make good progress on our leverage ratios this quarter. Both the firm and the bank SLR improved quarter over quarter by about 30 basis points so we are obviously within sight of our 5.5% target for the firm. And at 5.6% for the bank, we do have a clear path to our 6% plus target. Finally on this page, we continue to have a very strong liquidity position and remain in compliance with LCR. Moving on to the businesses starting on page 4 Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.4 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. We continue to see excellent growth in the underlying business drivers with average deposits up 9% in CBB, our active mobile customers up 23%, credit card sales volume of 12%, client investment assets up 19% and crossing the $200 billion mark. And according to J.D. Power, we continue to be ranked number one in overall customer satisfaction as well as for mortgage originations among large banks and number one in three of four regions for small business banking customer satisfaction. Finally across CCB, we expect to exceed our headcount reductions outlined at Investor Day. Turning to page 5, Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $894 million, up a significant 28% year on year on net revenue of $4.6 billion with an ROE of 33%. While we do continue to see some pressure on deposit margins, this continues to be more than offset by strong growth in deposit balances, the 9% I just mentioned among the highest in the industry. This deposit growth is driven by strong household growth and record customer retention. We added 800,000 net households since last year as our new branches continue to mature. On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong year over year growth in both debit and investment revenues as we deepen relationships with customers and as we see our Global Wealth Management strategy play out with more affluent customers. In Business Banking, the momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued. We had record originations up 46% year on year and 27% over last quarter back to levels that we last saw in 2012. We believe that this reflects a combination of improving industry trends driven by business optimism generally continuing to trend higher, and improving banker performance especially in our expansion markets where we have been investing and as our positive strategies mature. Our pipeline continues to strengthen. 2Q 2014 was the highest level since 2012 and we do expect this positive momentum and strong growth year-over-year to continue in the second half of the year. Expense is flat year on year with efficiency gains in the branches being offset by higher cost of controls that we have spoken about. But it was down quarter on quarter as cost of investments in controls are moderating. Turning to page 6 and Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $700 million for the quarter with an ROE of 16%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging and mortgage production pretax income excluding repurchase was a negative $74 million for the quarter a little (technical difficulty) of our guidance reflecting higher revenue margin on a mix shift towards retail loans and higher pipeline as well as good progress made in the quarter to reduce our fixed expenses. At this point market dependent, we expect the third-quarter results to be broadly similar to the second quarter, a small negative. Originations of $17 billion were flat quarter on quarter and down 66% year on year which is in a market that we estimate was seasonally up 25% quarter on quarter which shows that we continued to lose some share. Key drivers behind the share loss were the continuation of our strategy to reduce our participation in lower FICO and higher LTV government loans as well as the burnout of HARP. In addition, we did lose some share in other conventional resulting from price competition as we maintained discipline regarding pricing to our required returns. Mortgage production benefited in the quarter from a repurchase reserve release, a positive $137 million driven primarily by refinements in expectations regarding certain residual risks following the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2013. Onto servicing, net servicing-related revenue of $693 million is down slightly quarter on quarter but is higher than guidance due primarily to higher gains on [SIO] securities and Ginnie Mae loan sales. While we do expect to continue to benefit from both during the second half of the year to a lesser extent than the first and these gains can be lumpy. So we expect servicing revenue to decline in the third quarter to $600 million plus or minus and servicing expenses are modestly down quarter on quarter. MSR Risk Management was a net gain this quarter of $338 million driven by a $220 million positive model update on slower prepayment speeds which remember, we would have earned otherwise over time through model [miss] and which reflects the impact of the burnout on HARP as well as I mentioned. On real estate portfolios concentrating on credit, we see net charge-offs for the quarter of $111 million and reserve releases of $300 million in the purchase credit impaired portfolio reflecting actual and expected appreciation in home prices. There were no reserve releases in the quarter for the non-credit impaired portfolio although favorable loss and delinquency trends do continue. We do expect to see reserve releases in NCI over the next couple of years in total between $500 million and $1 billion as the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve. And lastly on real estate portfolios in the quarter, we added $5 billion of loans to the portfolio. Finally, mortgage headcount was down approximately 5000 year to date and we expect to exceed our Investor Day target of approximately 6000 for the full year of 2014. Turning to page 7, Card, Merchant Services & Auto. Net income of $840 million, down 33% year on year were down 11% excluding reserve releases delivering an ROE of 18%. While down on declining reserve releases, the results do reflect strong underlying metrics. Sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 25th consecutive quarter primarily due to strong sales engagement of new customers. Our new acquisition vintages are performing exceptionally well. In merchant services, we have seen strong volume and transaction growth year-over-year with our signed sales volume gaining momentum reflecting several large account wins in the quarter. Strong revenue of $4.6 billion was up slightly quarter on quarter but down 3% year on year and when you think about the year-on-year decline, we have reached the point where spread compression and strong fee growth offsets. So the net decline is driven by higher amortization of customer acquisition costs and the absence of fees related to discontinued products in 2013. Expense is up 8% quarter on quarter and 7% year on year driven by controls, the timing of marketing investments and this quarter includes $125 million of the legal expense I talked about. Moving on to credit, losses continue to improve albeit at a slower pace and the card net charge-off rate has remained very low at 288 basis points and we released $50 million of student lending reserves in the quarter. Card outstandings momentum has shifted. End of period outstandings grew by $1.8 billion or 1.5% year over year with growth coming across our product sets fueled by the strong sales performance I highlighted. Core growth is now outpacing runoff and we acquired over 2 million new accounts in the quarter, up 40% year on year. Before we move on, a few words on auto. New vehicle sales continued to grow year on year and the June SAR results reached the highest level since 2006. We have seen the 11th straight quarter of loan and lease growth as our partners continue to outpace the general market which remains competitive. The auto pipeline remains healthy, consistent with the recovery in the auto market. Moving on to slide 8 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $9 billion and an ROE of 13%. In banking, total revenue was $3.1 billion, down 2% year on year. IB fees, $1.8 billion, up 3%. We maintained our number one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic, and widened the gap to number two. Revenue growth was driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees and while debt underwriting fees were lower, we had strong relative performance for the quarter. The IB pipeline remains solid with an environment supportive of M&A and a large diversified IPO backlog. Treasury Services revenue of $1 billion was in line with our guidance, down 4% year on year driven by lower trade finance revenue and the impact of business simplification. Lending revenue was down $80 million year on year driven by lower NII but was up 5% quarter over quarter. Moving onto markets and investor services, reported markets revenue was down 14% year on year versus our guidance of 20% plus or minus with FIC down 15% and equities revenue down 10%. Included in these results are gains of over $100 million on the sale of market partner shares post-IPO. Excluding this, our results would have been down 15% year-on-year. In FIC the decline was driven broadly across macro products and in commodities with volatility remaining very low and with the exception of a few more active weeks in June, volumes also low. In equities, the decline was driven by derivatives while client volumes are highly correlated to volatility levels. In terms of outlook for the coming quarter and the second half, June was a better month somewhat broadly but that momentum has not continued into July so far and volatility remains very low across products. As such it is our [central case] that the third-quarter will face a similar environment through the first half of 2014 and we expect normal seasonal trends. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year on year primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. AUC reached a record $21.7 trillion, up 14% year on year. Quarter on quarter, revenue was up on seasonality in a depository receipt and agent lending businesses. Moving on to the expense, total expense was up 6% year on year. Compensation expense was down 8% with a comp to revenue ratio for the quarter of 31% and we expect a full-year comps revenue ratio to likely end between 30% and 35% rather than at the low end of the range. Non-compensation expense was up year on year by 20% with the quarter including over $300 million of legal expense and a little less than $300 million of non-core expenses associated with business simplification I mentioned earlier. Moving onto page 9 and the Commercial Bank, we had very good earnings in the Commercial Bank this quarter with net income up 6% from last year and an ROE 19%. We saw strong performance on key underlying business drivers driving revenue of $1.7 billion, up 3% sequentially with gross IB fees up 25% year on year driving the first half of the year to a record. And on higher NII driven by higher loan volumes and day counts. We added $3.3 billion of loans in the quarter with growth across the board in all of our businesses. Our consistent growth in real estate continued with loans up 2% in the quarter and 14% in the year. After a flat start to the year we are happy to see C&I growth of 3% in the quarter in line with the industry. Revolver utilization picked up 3 percentage points versus the end of last year. Pipelines are up which should be supportive for trends in the second half of the year. The environment remains competitive but stable driving some continued spread compression and we continue to see some pricing pressure to varying degrees in the businesses. Expense was relatively flat quarter on quarter but higher than last year reflecting our commitment to the regulatory and control agenda. Expect expenses for the business of approximately $700 million in the third quarter. Our credit performance remains exceptional with net recoveries in the quarter. Moving on to page 10 and Asset Management. An excellent quarter in Asset Management with net income of $552 million up 10% year on year and 25% quarter on quarter with a 25% ROE and a 30% pretax margin hitting our through the cycle targets. For the full year, these ratios will be slightly lower as the business continues to invest in both infrastructure and control as well as select front office hiring but we are on track to deliver at or through the cycle target for the full year of 2015. Revenue of $3 billion was up 8% year on year reflecting an increase in management fees driven by record long-term net inflows of $34 billion for the quarter including the benefit of a large institutional fixed income mandate. This marks the 21st consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion, up 16% year on year and we continue to expect strong flows going forward. Looking at the mix of flows by product, we saw continued strength in our multi-asset and alternative flows in line with our best quarter. In fixed income, we had our strongest quarter of flows ever and our best quarter in over a year excluding the large mandates I mentioned. And lastly despite solid equity market performance in the quarter, flows did not follow as investors showed hesitance to add to their positions at these levels. Expense of $2.1 billion was up 9% from a year ago primarily driven by higher cost of controls and investment in growth. Lastly in Banking, we reported solid performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances surpassed the $100 billion mark, up 17% year on year and 4% quarter over quarter with growth coming from both our US and our international markets. We continue to see a solid pipeline for loan demand for the remainder of the year and average deposits were also up year over year by 8% but seasonally down 1% sequentially. Moving on to page 11 and Corporate/Private Equity. Private Equity overall had a flattish result driven by net gains on dispositions partially offset by unrealized losses and our Private Equity portfolio declined by approximately $1 billion. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million. NII was a negative $10 million, better by $80 million quarter on quarter driven by higher investment securities balances and the continued benefit of higher reinvestment yields. In the quarter we deployed $27 billion in gross new investments. Finally on this page, other corporate. Net income was over $400 million. Included in the results are tax-related benefits of over $200 million and as I mentioned earlier, we reported firmwide legal expense pretax of $670 million for the quarter of which $227 million is here in other corporate. Moving on to outlook on page 12, we did receive positive feedback from our most recent guidance disclosure in the 10-Q so we have replicated it and updated it here. A few final comments. It is too early for us to give specific guidance for markets revenues but we do expect the current environment to persist into the third quarter and for the second half and also to experience normal seasonal trends. For the third-quarter, we generally expect mortgage production to be similar to this quarter, a small negative. We expect firmwide unadjusted expenses for the full-year of $58 billion plus or minus and expect credit trends to continue to be very strong across the board with consumer reserve releases that will be more periodic and modest. So to wrap up, a very, very strong result for the quarter notwithstanding headwinds reflecting the strength of each of our businesses and the benefit of our operating model. With that, operator, we would like to open up the line for questions. Questions and Answers
MARIANNE LAKE: So you got cut off at the beginning but you are asking for our earnings at risk on 100 basis point shift?
MARIANNE LAKE: Within the first quarter, we haven't disclosed it yet for the second quarter but it wouldn't be meaningfully different. In the first quarter, it was $2.5 billion.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I mean obviously earnings at risk is a representation -- it is an instantaneous parallel shift. If you look actually at our disclosures you can also see what a steepener looks like. So the way I would characterize the way to think about the impact of our asset sensitivity and interest rates rising is the way we described it both at Investor Day and at the Morgan Stanley conference which is when rates rise whenever that starts which may be in the second half of 2015 at the short end and the long end continues that over time that will deliver $8 billion to $10 billion of NII to the firm. But clearly the path to get there will be rate dependent and timing.
JAMIE DIMON: This is Jamie. I think on the funding side, we said we have met pretty much LCR and [SFS] and we think will be the [GLAC] or least we are very close to it. That is all embedded in interest-rate exposure which Marianne gave you and that is our base case. Obviously if the world changes, we may change how we go about and do that. But I think it is a very good base case to look at. We don't have any need to change it dramatically. I think you will all have to be prepared for the reason that rates raise -- obviously will change why people act a certain way.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we have to wait and see. I mean remember the United States has already gone beyond most other countries and they may just be referring to that that they intend to keep that or how they modify that.
MARIANNE LAKE: The way that we think about it, obviously we don't know how things may change in the future but between (inaudible), the buffers that we and other institutions are going to run above that with LCR and SFR, our own internal liquidity framework with capital stress pump testing under CCAR under extremely severe conditions, it feels like we have a box around this and so we are planning to run the firm based upon what we know today with an eye on obviously listening to all of the things you hear.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you very much.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you.
JAMIE DIMON: So keep in mind if the Fed, whether they use repo or just sell securities, that will reduce deposits, so factor with it, absolute formula. The question is whose deposits and what kind of deposits and when they might do something like that. I assume they will be fairly careful. I think what we simply were saying is that some of the deposits will come out of -- nonoperating wholesale deposits already have (inaudible). Some won't. Some will come out of retail, and just people need to be prepared for. I wouldn't put it in the earth-shattering category. Just people need to be prepared and be very thoughtful about how they go about that.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we are very comfortable with where we are.
MARIANNE LAKE: Remember, we are running -- LCR is an important measure. It is a regulatory measure. We are measuring it, we are reporting it, but we run the firm based upon our own internal liquidity check framework and what comes with that.
MARIANNE LAKE: Really what I would point you to is the discussions that we had largely at Investor Day which was to say that we continue to expect the mortgage expense story to play out over the course of the next few years which will be obviously a tailwind for us on expenses both in servicing but more particularly in production. So that is obviously a focus in 2015 and beyond. We also are expecting to start on a journey to delivering. You saw our CBB expenses, cost of control investment are moderating and Gordon outlined at Investor Day that the CBB business 2014 through 2016 as a relative matter would deliver approximately $1 billion of expense efficiency but the profile of that we haven't been through. And then Daniel is working through, as are all of the other CEOs, the expense story in the CIB and being as diligent as you would expect him to be given the environment. But one of our positions has always been that we are running this business for the longer term and we are going to be smart about the actions we take on expenses in order to make sure that we protect the franchise but that doesn't mean that we can't and won't be more efficient across the businesses. So we haven't actually given specific guidance at the firmwide level but that is the backdrop.
JAMIE DIMON: I just want to reiterate that we always have a waste cutting like real estate, people, straight-through processing, vendors, things where we think we got a little sloppy, where we are located, but we will never, ever ever stop investing in straight-through processing, better bankers, better training, Chase net, marketing, Sapphire, EBKs -- you know the new stuff from branches. So don't confuse the two. We will lump it in together for you. Internally, no one goes to a budget meeting and says I get my expenses down by cutting expenses and the really important things we need for the future. No one. We are not going to run the Company that way. We would rather earn less money.
JAMIE DIMON: Including in that is paying our people fairly.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say that it is a matter of good housekeeping that we would constantly be looking at making sure that we are simplifying our businesses where it makes sense to do it. But as a large matter, the macro matter, we are working through the things that we talk about, some of the things that you mentioned and there are no significant changes
JAMIE DIMON: We've got 1000 foreign correspondent banks, we sold CWT, we might very well -- we sold RPS. There are a bunch of product lines we have either closed down or eliminated and a lot of that is in the works. We put a light -- enhanced monitoring our other businesses and so we are well along the way but if something comes up that we think we should look at again, we will look at it again.
MARIANNE LAKE: The most significant revenue effect that is not yet in our run rate because the transaction is not yet closed is the exit of the physical commodities business. So obviously when that closes which may be in the early part of the fourth-quarter that would have an impact in the revenues both in the quarter and then in our run rate in 2015.
JAMIE DIMON: We gave you a number at Investor Day which -- we should probably update that number.
MARIANNE LAKE: I can give you the numbers now. So at Investor Day, we said that the impact in 2014 on revenues would be a decline of $1.6 billion. Just given the timing of the physical commodities deal, the impact in 2014 is going to be closer to $1.2 billion of which about $500 million is in our run rate already. And then when you annualize the things that will be complete by the end of the year, that 85% of everything is obviously going to get done. So once we close the year this year the impact this year will be $1.2 billion, the annualized impact that we gave was $2.8 billion and that is still our best estimate.
JAMIE DIMON: The important thing is the four beautiful franchises, Asset Management, Commercial Bank, CIB, CCB are all doing really, really well and this doesn't affect their ability to serve their clients at all.
MARIANNE LAKE: Remember also just for the purposes of completeness, it would be remiss of me not to say that expenses are also coming out as we take those revenues out and remember these are in large part businesses that were not at this time accretive to the overall firm's returns. So important to remember that.
JAMIE DIMON: I think because the government is still buying a big portion of net treasury issuance and because they are doing -- going into the repo market and taking cash out of the system, I think that number maybe has gone from $100 billion to $200 billion over time. Remember I believe that that repo can't be rehypothecated. So I do think some of those things that cause issues in the repo market, my guess is that will sort through over time. We do believe we see dealers reducing their books in repo and you have had a lot of statements about repo and collateral and capital against it so I feel things are going to sort out over time.
JAMIE DIMON: Not yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: So I would say that there hasn't been a shift in sentiment but sentiment is better. It is still better year-over-year and better quarter-over-quarter. It has allowed us to deliver growth in line with the industry and we do however maintain, absolutely maintain, our credit risk discipline as it relates to the commercial space. So it is competitive. It hasn't been the case that we have historically been losing on price, it has been more on credit discipline and on simplification and derisking but --.
JAMIE DIMON: I think Marianne mentioned it but in almost every category of C&I -- I'm talking about on the Commercial Bank -- utilization was up like 1% last quarter, maybe --.
MARIANNE LAKE: Utilization in commercial was up 3% since the end of the year.
JAMIE DIMON: Since the end of the year and you know, utilization is usually a pretty good measure of companies starting to expand and early on, it's receivables and inventory. You haven't really seen it in capital expenditures yet and if you looked at US capital expenditures in total including big businesses, they are kind of flat to down, that will ultimately be the driver of real growth. So if you start to see that, you are going to hopefully see a stronger economy but utilization is I think is the first sign.
JAMIE DIMON: No, but can I just give you a number? I think year-over-year that balance sheet is up mostly because of money we have in the Fed. Even quarter over quarter, we've got these -- we have $350 billion or almost $400 billion at central banks around the world. We have an investment portfolio of $350 billion. We have a loan portfolio of [$700 billion]. We have already told you when they start to reverse, Q3, some of those will automatically come down. So our balance sheet is kind of high because of all of this huge liquidity and securities in the balance sheet and eventually hopefully there will be more loans which are more productive and less just holding excess cash.
MARIANNE LAKE: Just to illustrate the point, if you are looking at the slides, you are looking at end of period assets that grew by $40 billion or so. If you look at the average, it was only [18] and we get a lot of volatility around cash movement at quarter end. So Jamie is right, there has been a significant amount of our growth that has been deposits and ultimately found its way on deposit with the central bank.
MARIANNE LAKE: I would say against that, having said that of course there is a natural healthy tension now with leverage rules that we are clearly strategically optimizing the way we use our balance sheet and that will have a natural tension to keep the balance sheet growth if there is growth to be more modest.
JAMIE DIMON: You are also seeing -- if you are talking about G-SIFI, the big Chinese banks, the big Japanese banks and some other banks around the world growing fairly rapidly, hopefully -- eventually we will use our G-SIFI scores a little bit too.
MARIANNE LAKE: And if we are right about the liquidity drain in QE, you will see a bunch of deposits flow out potentially in the second half of next year and see some of that growth reverse.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks for the question because I want to make sure I am very clear. So in June, we did see an uptick in activity in terms of client activity but volatility stayed very, very low and there was no specific catalyst for it, no catalyst that would lead us to believe that that would necessarily continue. And as we have moved into July, it so far has been our experience that it has not continued at that level. So it is more our guidance in the second half is that the 15% to 20% and the 20% plus or minus decrease that we have seen in the first half, that kind of environment is the one that we are facing over the second half. Now we are not guiding to a number because as you very well know however many trading days into the quarter and things can change so you are going to have to pick your level and we can't predict it any better than that.
JAMIE DIMON: It is just our operating assumption is that it will stay at low levels for a while. We know we are going to be wrong on that but you all have to pick whatever you think. We run the Company planning for low and hoping for better.
MARIANNE LAKE: We are not giving a specific guidance. It was 20% in the first quarter, 15% in the second, that kind of environment.
JAMIE DIMON: And the third and fourth are generally lower and it could be lower than that (multiple speakers) .
MARIANNE LAKE: Normal seasonality drivers.
MARIANNE LAKE: We called out the $300 million if that is what you are referring to in the CIB because it in our view anyway is a modestly sized and nonrecurring item. We are not expecting to have similar items like that. We may have some but we are certainly not our forecast that we are going to have that kind of level recurring. So really it is just to give you a sense that in the quarter we absorb that number you choose that you will to do with it in terms of your models but we don't consider that to be core.
MARIANNE LAKE: Not at this time, not significant.
MARIANNE LAKE: So first of all, these are all the moving parts, none of them are materially significant so operational risk went up a little bit, growth went up a little bit and offset against that, we continue to always on board positions onto approved models, continue to develop our models and get approvals for our models so that we can have the most efficient RWAs that we can have. And so we saw some of that. And also portfolio runoff so we were just giving you some color that flat RWA is actually the continuation of the work that we articulated at Investor Day that will ultimately drive it down to be closer to $1.5 trillion over the next 18 months.
JAMIE DIMON: We are a little inconsistent upfronting all of the negatives we phased in. We are not upfronting model approvals we expect to get. Model on boarding and stuff like that. There is some of that coming and obviously those need to be approved by regulators.
JAMIE DIMON: Not material. They are going to run off over time for RWA and everything else is not material. They can be restructured. I think it goes to 2017 now.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thanks, Betsy.
MARIANNE LAKE: We said relatively flat. It came up slightly in the quarter, obviously we are pleased with that and we told you that we expected core growth for the year to be 5% plus or minus and at this point that would still be our best assessment. If loan growth does continue to improve and improves to the point where our core loan growth is above 5% then yes, we would hope to enjoy the NII benefit. But as we look forward based upon current rates, we will be flat with a little bit of upward bias is our outlook until rates start to rise.
MARIANNE LAKE: Sorry, John, because you do continue to have albeit that everything is a little bit less than it was but you do continue to have offsets against that in terms of spread compression.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, if market implied curve is in fact how things play out.
MARIANNE LAKE: So first of all obviously what we can do is guided and limited by what we have approval to do. But yes, we did articulate that we were going to likely back end our share repurchases as we build towards our CET1 ratio. You can obviously see we built towards that nicely at 9.8%. And then yes, obviously particularly in the first half of the quarter, our price was favorable and we did share repurchases reflecting all of those things. When we look at the second half without giving specifics because we don't give guidance on repurchases, we have the capacity to do $5 billion more gross over the next three quarters and we have a target to hit above 10% and we will juggle those two things together but that gives us the capacity to continue to do some repurchases.
MARIANNE LAKE: We assume none in that. Think about the MSR risk management as we generally speaking expect our results to be close to home so plus or minus zero outside of any model updates because of our hedging strategy.
MARIANNE LAKE: So as much as I know and you want to hear it, we are not going to be able to talk about the specifics of what we are reserving for and we told you -- we said before that we had very little in the first quarter, we have $700 million pretax now. It is going to be this way for a while. We are going to have elevated and lumpy litigation costs as we work through the issues that you are aware of. And then with respect to mortgage, we have settled with a large proportion of our MBS risk with the governmental counterparties but we do still have some other civil claims. But we would characterize it more behind us than in front of us and we are working through it.
MARIANNE LAKE: On an absolute performance, so first of all two things primarily contributed to the better performance. We said 20% plus or minus. Remember that really could have been plus or minus when you go back three weeks before quarter end. So with the better activity in June, so June was a stronger month every day on average produces stronger results than the prior two months and that helped and we didn't have line of sight to that when we gave our guidance and when we affirmed our guidance. And then the second, I called out the market partner's shares, the IPO. We sold our shares post the IPO and generated gains of over $100 million which is a couple of points.
JAMIE DIMON: And the VAR, I mean it is very hard to predict FICC. We are always reluctant to do it because somehow you think you actually know what is going to be the (inaudible) couple of weeks and the VAR jumps are around but some of that jumping around is really I think of underwriting positions, CMBS warehouse positions and stuff like that which come and go.
MARIANNE LAKE: What I would say, Mike, is that what we have seen in the second quarter gives us reasons to be optimistic that we are going to continue to see growth at around those levels in the second half of the year. Like I said, it is not that we have seen a step change but that we have seen generally better sentiment, generally better utilization rates, generally higher pipelines. The phones are ringing. It is across geographies so it just feels like the environment is conducive for us to continue to be able to add. We have been very successful in the business banking space and yes, we have reached inflection in card. So it is our belief that we will have strong growth year-over-year in the second half but we are still in the early stages of seeing that happen.
JAMIE DIMON: It is not really a factor of people who are already income producing, locked in rates and things like that. It may very well be a factor for people who want to build new things. Not on the commercial side but we did look at on the residential side there have been occasions we have rising rates and improving housing. So depending why rates are going may be the more determinant factor than just the fact that rates are going up. Rates are going up because you have a healthy economy, that may be more important than just the fact that rates are going up. We have not done the same thing in commercial, we probably should.
MARIANNE LAKE: For us what we are doing is being consistent on our credit discipline and so we have talked I think partly in the first half of the year about us not participating in some of the growth that others saw because we have maintained line as it relates to particularly structured credit structures and aggressive structures rather than pricing. And so we are consistently doing that. We are not changing that and our credit across products also mortgage, commercial remains broadly consistent, we are not changing that either. So for us we are just maintaining our credit discipline. But yes, it is a very competitive place out there right now across the products and so we are seeing a little bit of that aggressiveness. We saw it in the quarters running up to this. We still see it now although it is not worse.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't think we have disclosed that. It hasn't been a breakeven business over a long period of time. Obviously hasn't earned much money in the last few quarters and we are still negotiating something. It could be soon, it won't be all of OEP. It will be a part of it. And then part of the number of you see, because I think there is $6 billion of total private equity are all heritage investment that were made by JPMorgan Chase and etc. before the Bank One merger. So they are all eventually -- that $6 billion will be zero and that frees up what, $3 billion of equity capital effectively.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, just to be clear, the $2.8 billion if you go back and look at Investor Day was for all of our business simplification agenda not the physical commodities. I just called out physical commodities as being A, a big piece of it, and B, as being the biggest piece left to happen in 2014. So just to be clear on that. And then yes, the $2.8 billion came with expenses of $2.3 billion against it. We didn't disclose the capital but when you take that into consideration it was at or below our cost of capital, not additive to returns.
MARIANNE LAKE: Actually, it is in fixed.
MARIANNE LAKE: We haven't actually broken out specifically in that way but I can characterize it for you. Obviously in mortgage production, the first chunk of expenses is truly variable meaning it is paying for production on a variable basis to the salesforce and then you have a bunch of what we would called semi-fixed costs which are effectively the operators, the people, the FTEs. And then you do have true fixed costs which is the management, the real estate, the technology. When you have a very, very small market which I think you would agree a $1.1 trillion or lower market is very small, then it is hard with the fixed cost structure to make a lot of money in the mortgage business particularly if you are taking a hard line which we are on the types of mortgage product that we want to participate in. But over time it doesn't stop the fact that this is going to be a healthy functioning mortgage market and we want to be a scale player. So it is tricky in this kind of very, very small market but we are focusing on fixing our fixed cost base and trying to get out as much efficiency as possible.
JAMIE DIMON: We've been spending a lot of time in that and doing deep dives and trying to figure it out and unfortunately this one won't be the end of the year. I think of it as hopefully by the end of 2015 we give you clear sight about how we will be making normal profitability there which may take until 2016.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right and it has always been a cyclical volatile business and we had very, very strong performance over the course of 2011 and 2012 and into the first half of 2013 and we are now at that cyclical point, that cyclical low and we need a lot of things to happen. But trust me when I tell you that the fixed cost base is our number one focus or among our number one focuses and we are working very hard at it.
JAMIE DIMON: We are not exiting, just no longer doing it and it is in runoff mode.
MARIANNE LAKE: Right. So we stopped originating new loans but we do have a portfolio of loans that we are managing and as they run off, we will experience all of the usual charge-offs, reserve releases but not exiting.
MARIANNE LAKE: We said it was driven by derivatives. Cash out of prime brokerage did better. Prim did better than cash.
MARIANNE LAKE: So just on the mortgage thing, we are giving up share but remember that we distribute a significant amount of the mortgages that we produce and in this quarter, we actually portfolio-ed $5 billion of mortgages so we are not losing share in (multiple speakers). So we are adding to the portfolio for mortgage at just a slightly different dynamic. We are outperforming on sales growth in cards so ultimately that will fuel outstanding growth that hopefully will be better than the industry but clearly it is modest at this point. Our C&I, we are in line if not potentially gaining a little share but we continue to outperform in real estate particularly multi-family real estate and asset management.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think you called it well on mortgage. Obviously the mortgage market and housing conditions outside of home prices are challenging and that looks like it is set to be a slower journey. But if you step back and look across all of our other businesses, when I talked about the underlying core performance drivers growing strongly, that reflects our strategy. So we continue to build and grow our businesses demonstrated by those performance drivers as well as simplify and address the control agenda and we are making the appropriate progress on both of those. And it is showing in our results. I mean a quarter where obviously there are some challenges to print over a 14% return on tangible common equity is evidence of the strategy working. If you go through each of the comments I made in asset management, we are investing in the sales force, we are seeing that deliver growth, we have record inflows, we are seeing international deliver loan growth. It is very consistent.
JAMIE DIMON: You haven't seen us give you a roadmap on how we are going to get from 7% return on tangible common equity to 14%. We are already at 14%.
JAMIE DIMON: No, look, I can't over emphasize this. We do not run the Company for quarterly profits. We make long-term decisions in people, systems, technology, products, services, stuff like that and a lot of things drive short-term profits but the profit you have in any one quarter relates to the decisions you made the last five years. And so we feel great about these companies. The big weak spot which we all acknowledge is mortgage and we are going to put -- we have got great people there. We are going to put elbow to the metal there, we are going to invest some more money in their systems. We've got some catch-up to do. We got caught in the middle of as you know WaMu, Bear Stearns, origination platforms. But if you look at each of these businesses, they are all doing fine and we are looking at how we can grow them over the next five or 10 years and that is what we are going to do. I honestly mean it. I don't care whether FIC is up 10% or 15% or down 10% or 15% next quarter. I actually think that is a complete waste of time.
JAMIE DIMON: I think most of that has been done. So you have seen not all of it but the full effect of that in terms of which segments we are getting out of, which ones we are going to focus on, which ones we put enhanced monitoring in so the same thing in the CIB with our correspondent banking. There may be more. We are always going to do good housekeeping and there are some clients we have had conversations with that are still on the books but they will be leaving down the road. But none of those things will be material to the future of this Company. They may affect revenues a little bit in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year but that is not why we are doing it. We are doing this to protect ourselves, run the business properly, meet our regulatory and control objectives.
MARIANNE LAKE: Think about this, the core number, the reported number being primarily driven by the legacy mortgage and credit card portfolios so the high end activity that we have been talking about is immaterial in the context of that runoff portfolio. That is what is driving the difference. So we will continue to see that portfolio run off and as it runs off and gets smaller, it will have less of an impact but it has been a fairly consistent story.
MARIANNE LAKE: We have a large market share so while we may be outperforming the market what we see is generally a fairly good picture of what is happening. And what I can tell you is if you decompose our growth, you have still strong high single-digit growth in nondiscretionary spend categories driven principally in grocery and oil space which is not all that unsurprising but I think is actually instructive about consumer spending and inflation. And then if you look at the discretionary growth which is growing even more strongly in the double-digit territory, it is across the board. It is travel, it is restaurants, it is retail, it is across the board so consumers are spending very strongly in both categories.
JAMIE DIMON: (multiple speakers) Merchant processing we are growing at like 12% a year and we are investing more money, do a better job for merchants there and we have 35 million people bank online. I think 15 million who use mobile bank, it was 12 million or 15 million that use mobile banking. So you are going to see us extend products and services all of which hopefully will be merchant friendly and consumer friendly.
JAMIE DIMON: Mostly merchants aggregating their transactions.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: Correct.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, so our general longer-term outlook is our tax rate is 30% plus or minus just given obviously the pre-tax (inaudible) of the 2014 market, it will be slightly lower than that more in line with this quarter. (multiple speakers)
JAMIE DIMON: I don't remember if you mentioned it, but in other, there is private equity which was close to zero and bounces around. Treasury and CIO, which was close to zero and kind of will stay there and there is other corporate where a normal rate would be around 200, this quarter was around 400 because of some of the tax benefits. Think of that as going back to 200 give or take next quarter for your models.
MARIANNE LAKE: So of the $5 billion, $3.6 billion was jumbo, about $400 million was (inaudible) and then about $1 billion was conventional so that is how it breaks down. So mostly jumbo, yes, and we are holding share in jumbo. And with respect to the market share loss, it was principally two things. It was principally a strategy that we've talked about to do less in the high -- high LTV, low FICO space. We priced to the risk-adjusted return that we see in that business given the cost of service the loans that default and that is what the impact has been on our market share. And then also the HARP burn out, we were very successful in HARPing our loans over the course of the last couple of years. Our borrowers who our technically eligible are no longer responding so we are seeing that burn out. The bit that is really truly the conventional loss which there was some, is really on price competition and we absolutely intend to compete on price.
JAMIE DIMON: When you say high FICO -- that is FHA? So our FHA volumes are way down and we've studied FHA based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that, we have lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA. We are trying to figure out what we should do about it going forward. Just to give you three numbers, we collected $600 million in insurance. They disputed $200 million. The government called that a fraud. We reimbursed $600 million to get out of the lawsuit because it was a threatening lawsuit even though in my opinion it was a commercial dispute between FHA and ourselves about that. And the whole time FHA collected another $1.8 billion in premium. So the real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we are still struggling with that. We want to help the consumers there but we can't do it at great risk to JPMorgan so until they come up with some kind of safe harbors or something, we are going to be very, very cautious in that line of business.
JAMIE DIMON: I think it has slowed down a little.
MARIANNE LAKE: It went down slightly I think.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, you are talking about different borrowers (inaudible) so it might be something that was two million deposits and some start to borrow money but in general, you are right.
MARIANNE LAKE: So if you look at commercial just as an illustration of your point, what we have got going on is utilization rates in the last few quarters have picked up by 3 points. They are at 33% still much, much lower than you would expect them to be over time which would be slightly above 40%. But you do see deposits flattening out. In fact, there is a little bit of decline. It is not absolutely the case at this point that we can say people are starting to spend their deposits and utilize their lines. As Jamie said, CapEx is still not really out there but that is what you would expect and in this business we did not see strong growth in deposits.
MARIANNE LAKE: First of all, just to make a conceptual point which is we didn't have a target for loan deposits. We were just trying to make the point that obviously as we think forward to the impact of interest rates on our performance over time, we would expect both a mix shift in deposits back towards interest earning and CDs but also expect to see the economy growing and loans growing and that needed to be taken into consideration. So it wasn't really a target, it was just a simulation to start with that. But it was based loosely on levels that we have seen at least in part the cycle that we were referring to. And then you are right, there is a dynamic where because of LTR, we will always have a -- because of our liquidity requirements internally as well, we will have liquid assets that will be structurally higher than they would had previously been and therefore from a mix perspective, that would have an impact. But at this point given where loan to deposits are, I think that would be a high class problem to be talking about.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember there are some unused lines so there is not a loan on the balance sheet that still 100% LCR. So what's really going to happen is it is going to be done at the client level -- capital, LCR, commitments, etc, that is where you are really going to have to manage it, the capital level, the desk level, etc.
JAMIE DIMON: What we have seen a little bit of is trade finance cost have gone up, a little bit in municipal businesses and there you have seen a little bit more restructuring on the type of business people do. Remember some of the repricing may not take place in the product, it may take place in the relationship because all products have loss leaders, etc. But we haven't seen a huge amount of repricing taking place yet.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think if you think about --.
JAMIE DIMON: I have heard some complaints by the way that some of the revolvers are smaller and shorter. It is not the price as much as it is the sizing. And then you have heard some commentary in the market that inventories -- bonds are lower and spreads will gap out so you are starting to see some of it but eventually -- I have never seen a business where the cost of goods sold doesn't eventually get priced in the business. It doesn't have to be priced into the eggs and the milk, it just has to be priced in the transaction, the whole bag the person walks out of the supermarket with.
MARIANNE LAKE: I think one way to look at it is to say while we are absolutely managing through this complex environment, Basel III Tier 1 common still is our binding constraint at the margin, that is how we allocate capital to the businesses and that is the sort of primary lend that we are using to price. And what you are going to see, as Jamie talked about, is that the leverage and LCR and other constraints including stressed capital are going to play out at the client level as we just are becoming more efficient at how we deploy our balance sheet rather than necessarily a repricing strategy.
JAMIE DIMON: And CCar, we are pushing CCAR down. To the extent we can, we are going to push CCAR down to those things which create CCAR-ness.
JAMIE DIMON: I wouldn't hold your breath. Some people are leaving businesses, some are optimizing decline levels, some are having strategic changes and it will happen over time and we are quite patient about it. We are in no rush. We're not going to try to lead it or anything like that. It will happen over time. Like I said, you have seen it in trade finance, you've seen it in certain municipal businesses, you have seen it in -and all the rules aren't final. When the rules become final, people may react differently.
MARIANNE LAKE: Yes, the improvement at the bank and the holding company was retained earnings, [pressed] net of capital distributions but we continue to work through all of the other initiatives we have to optimize leverage including compression trades and pair ups and the like. That is actually happening a little bit more slowly than we had thought just broadly in the industry. It still presents an opportunity, it is not the most sizable opportunity but we are diligently getting after it. And then with respect to (inaudible), we estimated clearly it is a complex calculation so we will be slightly wrong in our estimate. We estimated it to have a benefit for the firm of 30 basis points and for the bank at 40 basis points. Yes, we would expect that at some point it would be ultimately adopted by the US regulators but that doesn't look like it expects to be helping our numbers this year or next.
MARIANNE LAKE: It is essentially cyclical. I mean I wish we could actively manage it down because it is positive (inaudible) calculation but the truth of the matter is it is a factor of activity levels.
MARIANNE LAKE: We don't think it is significant.
JAMIE DIMON: So CRA, remember is a combination of lower and middle income mortgages so we will obviously try to meet those commitments. It includes how many branches you have in lower and middle income so we will continue to build that. It is a function of CDFI, like lending to small business or community development funds which we will continue to do. So it runs a whole gamut and we will meet our CRA commitment. Yes if you don't do in the FHA, it hurts you a little bit but to do FHA. lose billions of dollars that is a whole different level of shareholder responsibility and so we've got to be very careful how we handle that. I am hoping FHA comes forth and comes up with some real bright lines and harbors to make it easy for us to try to do what the government wants us to do but we can't get penalized severely for some of the things that happen.
JAMIE DIMON: It is all of that. We are going to meet CRA. We report CRA to our sellers every month and like I said, it cuts across a wide variety of things that we do for people and we just did this great thing in Detroit that is a lot of CRA credits. We can you mortgages ourselves that we can put on balance sheet that we think are less risky than FHA insurance. So we will figure it out. We are just thoroughly, thoroughly confused about how we got treated, how we've got it going forward and we are kind of waiting for -- we have spoken to government for some kind of guidance going forward.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes.
MARIANNE LAKE: It's deals and reps and warrants.
JAMIE DIMON: It is the reps and warrants that there should be a commercial resolution of the dispute but you don't have [treble] damages if something goes wrong.
MARIANNE LAKE: Thank you.",0.15999999999999992,-0.13800000000000026,0,0.09439273555452055,0.10526184372338226
46,Q3_2008,"
JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: So let me just give a couple of overall comments before we take some questions. Obviously, we necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment. We don't know what the environment is going to be. Mike took you through all the credit numbers. If you look at them, other than home lending, which we think is far worse than we would have expected, we're actually not that bad, non-performers, delinquencies in Card, et cetera, but when you see this kind of unemployment, this contained of uncertainty, the reduced consumer spend, we are getting braced for increasing loan loss reserves going forward. So it's reasonable as a shareholder if you'll expect that trade results can be very tough forward, that charge-offs are going to be going up, that loan losses will be added at least the next couple quarters. But we're going into an environment with an extremely strong balance sheet, 8.9% Tier 1 before the government's addition to that, very strong loan losses or leading among the strongest in the industry, which probably will be strengthened going forward. And I think of note when you go through this press release, there is real growth. In some areas it's in market share like investment banking and mortgages, even though it's a tough business, in other areas it's really broad growth in deposits and loans and you see that in TSS, the Private Bank, and the Commercial Bank, so we feel pretty good about it. Even in the Card business where we have kind of low expectations for spend, our spend is up 5%, and from what we know Visa numbers are more like zero. So we seem to be gaining a little bit of share there too. I want to point out in the Investment Bank, one of the things -- if you back out losses, which we don't think you should do, but the trading results were pretty good. But another way to view that is based on what we just went through in September, and obviously for the whole quarter, but September in particular, you've got to feel pretty good with the violent swings in volatility that we were able to manage through that process across all of our products globally and not be highly surprised. That goes from the Lehman bankruptcy to the AIG issues to swings in certain securities of 25% in a day. And you can imagine what it's like to manage through that process. And I think for our people here, I think it's very important to note it was an unbelievable thing to watch the people accomplish the WaMu acquisition, managing the portfolios, a lot of these same people were dealing with clients on mortgages and issues trying to do the right thing for clients every day. So it makes you really proud to watch what the people here are able to accomplish and I think it also portends very well what can be accomplished in the future. I will also mention on the Treasury package, because I know it's in the back of your minds, we were presented with a package from the government and this is the way that JPMorgan saw it. The United States Government is trying to do some very powerful things to fix the situation. And a lot of people can come up with a whole bunch of different programs, but they had one, and I think what they're doing in this package, plus all the prior things that have been done, is very powerful and you will start to see some effect. So we really saw this as doing something which is very good for the system. It is equally true if you said, well, they're asymmetric benefits for -- it could be a negative for JPMorgan versus competition. That may very well be true, but we did not think that JPMorgan should be selfish or parochial and try to stop what's good for the system, because it might be mildly bad for us relative to some of our competitors. So we hope it will work. There's $25 billion of capital. If it comes in the door, we hope to find ways to be able to use it to benefit our shareholders and to continue to be there for our clients. I do want to point out that we are there for our clients. Commercial loans are up 18%. The Investment Banking loans are way up, and a lot of the things we do every day, we are trying to do the best we can to be in business for our clients, even in some categories where if you ask the question if you borrow at today's marginal cost and lent out at today's yields in home equity/auto, you are probably losing money. But we still try to stay in business in the right way for people who walk into our branches or deal with our bankers. So we will stop there and open the floor to any questions you all may have.
JAMIE DIMON: We've had some gain in prime broker, and I'm going to say if you look at total balance has been able to go something like 25% over the quarter. So Bear is performing the way we expect, but I don't remember the specific numbers of what it did in the equity.
JAMIE DIMON: A small net positive, but not a big net positive.
JAMIE DIMON: That number alone, if it stays where it is today, could cost us $100 million a month in that business. We don't expect it to stay there. And obviously there are actions we can take that can reduce that over time.
JAMIE DIMON: It's a non voting preferred, so we don't expect the government to get involved in our business. But it is clear that the government would like us use the capital to facilitate clients to make loans and stuff like that, and we want to do that, too, so I think we have a common interest in this.
JAMIE DIMON: Again, I don't think the government is telling us what to do with the capital. When you say leveragable, I think you can use it. We fully expect to use some of it to do a good job for our shareholders. The government guarantee on the debt side just makes it easier for banks to roll over their liabilities and some banks are having trouble doing that. JPMorgan was not.
JAMIE DIMON: I think if you are a bank that's filling a hole, obviously you can't do that. If you are a bank that is not filling a hole, obviously you can do some of that. But we just got it. We haven't even got it yet, so we're just sitting here making sure we do it right. And obviously it will relate to the environment you see going ahead. It's very important for us, just like I think it's very important for the government, that all of these institutions be able to weather whatever happens coming forward.
JAMIE DIMON: Look, I don't think it's highly relevant to us, honestly. We're down to smaller numbers now, and so the answer is probably not, but we'll see how the details come out and figure out then. But I think the TARP facility, when it comes out, may very well help the market and that will help anyone who wants to trade those markets, because you will have real prices, real discovery and real ability to how you manage your own assets and capital.
JAMIE DIMON: I think we've been clear right from the beginning, there were no valuation reserves ever in the Bear Stearns deal. All those assets came over and were marked.
JAMIE DIMON: At fair value. There were reserves for litigation, severance, a whole bunch of stuff like that, but they were our best estimate. There's nothing left over from Bear Stearns. If you said what would your losses have been in mortgages this quarter had you not done the Bear Stearns deal, my guess is about 40% of that came from Bear Stearns.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't know. I think the paperwork is not finished on that. And obviously, we are going to read that very carefully.
JAMIE DIMON: I would be willing to use it for anything that made sense to JPMorgan shareholders.
JAMIE DIMON: There's no Fed backup. The Fed is financing $30 billion of assets and we're taking the first $1.1 billion or whatever the number is of loss there. Again, we've been very consistent. We think the Fed is going to get all their money back and we expect to get a little bit of our first loss note back, too. But I don't know. They're managing that. It's up to them and it depends how they manage it over time. They make their own reports, by the
JAMIE DIMON: It's about what it started at. And it's obviously bounced all over the place in the last month.
JAMIE DIMON: We have made no changes to our accounting. I think what the SEC guideline sent out is that, in a market where there's no trading, that you've got to use your judgment and models and stuff like that. We've made no change in ours. I think the European banks -- we are already allowed if we want to move from a trading account to a health and maturity account. We took you all through that last time. We did do that with a little bit of stuff. We put up a lot more reserves, not less, when we did that. As a matter of fact, we wanted more reserves. I think they said the banks can do that themselves in Europe now.
JAMIE DIMON: We think we are going to be fine in those risks, but we just want to point it out. There's really two things, to simplify a little bit. One is trading, honestly all of us thought that if you ever saw a -- we used to call it the major dealer exit, that it would be very tough on trading. It was but I think it was -- I think the street was able to get through that rather quickly and easily. But there are still some open issues relating to that, but not big. And the second is we were a huge financing tri-party agent and we have collateral against that and some of that collateral we have to liquidate, some of that belongs to some other people. We think that will all sort out.
JAMIE DIMON: So first of all, keep in mind that we already had eliminated double cycle billing and we had already eliminated off-us pricing, this is where we price -- that we changed your pricing because of FICO score changes or something like that. So two of the biggest things that people complain about, we already don't do. So put them to the side. And that cost us money. I forgot the number. We disclosed here at one point, it took like
JAMIE DIMON: So the other stuff, and there's a whole bunch of stuff out there. I would put in the category of it could be significant, so any one change on its own could be hundreds of millions of dollars, or something like that in total they could be well over $1 billion. But there are actions that would take place that would that would change a lot of that. So for example, if you can't reprice certain loans, you are not going to make certain types of loans. If you have to have people pay off teaser rate loans last on a series of loans, we're not going to make teaser rate loans. So a lot of that stuff I think competitively it will cause kind of changes in profits in the short run, but not in the long run. It will change your prices. If you cannot price for risk, you are going to charge everybody else more.
JAMIE DIMON: We already have, but honestly, some of the fees or outstandings we were going to pull back on weren't that profitable anyway. So we're going to run the business for profit. If outstandings go down $10 billion, so be it.
JAMIE DIMON: Nothing other than that.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me explain. So Corporate has a $100 billion portfolio, and that portfolio is for interest rate exposures, for collateral reasons, to manage the balance sheet of the company. We are moving some of that portfolio slowly and carefully into higher yielding assets. Because remember, we're here for shareholders. And some of these assets we think are going to give great returns to shareholders over time. So it's not any great rush, but those assets will include a little bit of AAA CLO, a little bit of bank preferred, a little bit of Alt-A, a little bit of CMBS. And we're not going to do it ad hoc, we're just going to do it over time. So those that they move were the same type of assets they were buying. And they were moved to fair value, so there's no benefit.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, most of those will continue to be marked to market in the treasury portfolio. So you will see a little more volatility in Corporate, because more of the assets there are being held in a trading portfolio, because they have -- for a whole bunch of reasons they have to be, but again, like we said, we are here for shareholder results. And if we have to take a little bit more risk to do a good thing for shareholders, we're willing to take a little more volatility.
JAMIE DIMON: They were really, really good.
JAMIE DIMON: Honestly, it was an exceptional performance. Some areas I think the rising tide lifted all boats, so I think you'll see a lot of trading desks in certain currencies and certain rates where the rising tide lifted all boats. In other areas, our people just did an exceptional job. Emerging markets, we were hedged for downturns on the equity side. We were prepared and positioned for markets going down, so we benefited from that. And we're not taking big bets on it, but it was a pretty good performance. Again, we don't expect that to repeat, though.
JAMIE DIMON: We think in the market share side on the wholesale side, yes. You see that in TSS. We think in Private Bank the answer would be yes. Retail, the answer is no. Part of the reason, we weren't competing aggressively for funds, nor are we in areas where you had this big flight to quality. So I think if you were in California or Florida and you were strong, you had a big inflow. We weren't in California and Florida, so we weren't the beneficiary of flight to quality in California and Florida -- but we think we're probably gaining a little bit of share. I think deposits in the last month are up $100 billion in total. That number may be off a little bit, but it's a huge number.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me step back. Prime/LIBOR has a huge negative effect we took on Card. It's got a modest beneficial affect across other businesses, so that's not a big deal and it doesn't affect -- directly affect the origination business. The origination business, and I think it's true for a lot of people in the industry, Meredith, that people have gone back to old fashioned 80% LTV, real verified income, more disciplined appraisals, and then in some areas they won't even go to 85% LTV because of expected home decreases, so we are not at 80% in California, Nevada, or Florida.
JAMIE DIMON: We're at 65%. So that's why it's down. I think it's true for us and everybody else. Almost everything being originated is eligible for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or FHA. So therefore you have this great reduction for us and other people in origination. Obviously the quality of that stuff is going to be much higher.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think the answer is probably yes, but we'll never really know. And so if everyone pulls credit out of California, obviously it will accelerate the depreciation of homes in California and make it harder and scarier for people to provide credit. Let me just make a general comment about a crisis like this. One of the things that happens, which I think the government is focusing on, is there are a lot of individual actors. I am talking about you as investors, banks as providers of credit, individuals, small businesses, large businesses, all start to take actions that are rational for them as an individual or corporation, but in total, can cause exactly what you are talking about. And that's one of the things that the government is trying to reverse. It's not just the banks. It's the individuals who invest in banks, it's people who provide capital to other financial institutions who are pulling it out or moving their money back overseas. And so you do see a little bit of that, and they are trying to arrest that. That is the one thing that's got people most scared and they are trying to stop it. Like I said before, I think what the government is doing is pretty powerful medicine. I say the governments around the world is pretty powerful medicine, and I think will you start to see some beneficial effect of that in the next couple weeks.
JAMIE DIMON: We're not big speculators, but we are buying slightly more risky assets and we're growing our businesses everywhere, so we're not panicking. Credit cards were up, credit card receivables are up. We are not pulling out of California. We're still going there. We're still marketing. Obviously we try and modify what's going on, but we are not going to say, ""yahoo, this is over"", and extend credit like we did without fear. If you are not fearful, you're crazy.
JAMIE DIMON: We know you are. We're waiting for you to reverse your position.
JAMIE DIMON: So leverage loans we did, and I'll give you some numbers now. Ready? Prime loans is not really applicable. Securities are marked in the high 50s. Alt-A performing loans about mid 70s, non-performing loans, 40s. That's loans. Alt-A securities, high 20s. Subprime mid-30s. CMBS loans mid-80s. Securities mid-70s, that's all we are going to give you because it's competitive information.
JAMIE DIMON: It's mostly vintage, Bill.
JAMIE DIMON: We may change our reporting of that and combine so we don't cause this confusion going forward. One of this things I should mention -- Mike mentioned it, it's when we look at the mortgage business, by the way, that we kind of looked at the $12 billion ongoing, it's trading, moving, that's what we need to do to service clients, properly marked, you shouldn't see huge -- obviously risk in trading but it should be back to more normal kind of risk. And there's $6 billion, it's marked, but put it in as kind of liquidating, very hard to trade. There's certain residuals you can't trade at all. And it's marked down to we're going to get -- I would believe we are going to get very substantial returns from 10 to 20%, (inaudible) as we liquidate it using fairly bad assumptions. So we don't like it, but it's not that big a deal any more.
JAMIE DIMON: I just think you should be very cautious. I'm guessing what the environment is going to be. So this crisis isn't over, so we are just guessing, like you can guess on your own. We don't know anything that you don't know. We are just guessing that it still can be pretty tough out there for awhile. You might have some more markdowns that -- Mike had mentioned that we have really healthy loan losses, $77 billion of loans I think the number is. We have almost 4% up against that. That's historically high, but it's very idiosyncratic. If one big company fails, that could be a huge loss for us, so we're just prepared for it to be a little tougher in the Investment Bank. We hope to make some money, but we are not going to count on it for now.
JAMIE DIMON: I wouldn't be shocked if we make a lot of money one of these quarters either, by the way.
JAMIE DIMON: A little bit, a little bit in alt-A, maybe a little bit in some of the CMBS stuff. Remember, TARP
JAMIE DIMON: -- just the anticipation might cause some of that. Surprisingly we haven't really seen anything in agencies. CMBS, which spreads are still damn near the highs and we think those are probably very good buys. I would expect one day, we're going to wake up, those snap in dramatically. And then we'll probably be mad at ourselves we didn't buy more.
JAMIE DIMON: It was realized in the AFS portfolio. There was some trading losses in there that -MICHAEL CAVANAGH: Some trading losses on some non-interest rate products and just changing coupon trades in some of the mortgages on there that were realized gains.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't have the number handy, Glenn, and we haven't really talked through it exactly.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, it includes -- the way we understand it, it includes CP, promissory notes, maturing debt, all unsecured, holding company and bank, so it's a pretty big number. And it's 125% of that.
JAMIE DIMON: We'll get back to you.
JAMIE DIMON: I think the second you see a levelization of charge-offs, with some certainty going forward, that you don't need any additions to reserves. Keep going until all the questions are asked.
JAMIE DIMON: Okay. So once you -- once we decide to go in the program I was thinking, can we have $50 billion? So think of it this way. Obviously by the time you get to 9%, you will probably want to have paid it off. And the warrants are equal to the value you are getting. So in our case, they are going to get warrants, the way it's currently written, 10-year warrants on $3.75 billion of stock. And those warrants are worth -- you can estimate at $1.2 billion, whatever you come up with, which is an additional cost on the $25 billion. So it's 5%, plus the way I look at it, a year, plus another 5% for the full term. You just monetize the cost of the warrants, so it's not bad money that way. There is a way if you refinance it sooner, and you've got to refinance it with real Tier 1 capital, that you can eliminate half the warrants, and we'll deal with that in due course. That to me becomes purely a financial decision, to do that or not do that, but the government made this part of it not an unattractive thing so that people can get the capital, use the capital, and hopefully do some good with the capital.
JAMIE DIMON: It's not the shares. It's warrants for $3.75 billion worth of stock.
JAMIE DIMON: You could do your own share calculation. The market value of those warrants would be something like $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion. You can use your own model.
JAMIE DIMON: Use your own model. I'm simply saying, think of that, it's only -- of the whole $25 billion, it's another 5%, maybe 6%. So if you spread it over the first five years, of the 5% of money, your money is costing you 6.5%. It's still cheaper than most companies can raise money at today. And it's real Tier 1, so it's very cheap Tier 1. So to that extent, it's not a bad economic transaction.
JAMIE DIMON: There is a way to reduce them at one point, but you could argue that's a lot of people that won't want to, because that's cheaper capital than you could otherwise get, if they think they can do something with it.
JAMIE DIMON: It's all Tier 1 capital, yes.
JAMIE DIMON: The warrants are not Tier 1 capital. They are just a dilution on the balance sheet, I think.
JAMIE DIMON: I think what they said is 10 basis points in that. And think of that as an operating account guarantee. I think the real point of that wasn't for JPMorgan, it's for really smaller community banks and stuff who do a lot of business, small business, middle market, and they don't want those people to be afraid that their operating accounts are at risk.
JAMIE DIMON: It doesn't mean anything to us, Ron, either way, whether we do it or don't.
JAMIE DIMON: Nancy, I don't really think so. And I think that one day everything will have normalized again. It might be three years out or five years out. I think what they really wanted to do -- and I don't know how long they worked on this, so I wouldn't assume it was just three days. I do think they had to do something relative to the rest of the world. If you were in their shoes, you would look and it and say, if the rest of the world is guaranteeing deposits and the United States is not, the rest of the world -- you might create other consequences. But I agree with you, making policy on the run is a very hard thing to do and always has these huge unintended consequences, which is really hard to forecast or have any foresight on at all. But I think one day it will normalize and it will make raising capital for banks more expensive for banks. We'll go back to a more normal world and people will probably spend a lot more attention on credit, which they should.
JAMIE DIMON: I think that one of the consequences is that this program obviously helps the weaker more than it helps the strong. And I think I mentioned at the beginning that, if you don't want to be parochial and selfish, as long as it's really materially helping the system, we all should be in favor of it. We can sit around the table and argue all day long, we would have been better off, and it's true -- you're not better off if the system goes down. But I don't think the intent on the treasury, I think they're very conscious of -- they don't intend to hold up failing banks. And you haven't seen them do that. What you have seen them do is be pretty aggressive to try to get failing banks in the hands of good owners. So they are going to have, throughout this program, the devil will be in the details how they manage it. We'll all be looking at how they really manage it going forward. And we'll be second guessing them, too, at one point.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you very much. We'll talk to you soon.",0.25,-0.5460000000000014,0,0.11188501187528425,0.14589074783746925
47,Q3_2009,"
MIKE CAVANAGH, CFO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Great. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining Jamie and I. We will go through the usual slide presentation that's available on the web. I refer you to slide 20 which gives the usual forward-looking comments disclaimers for you to read at your own leisure. With that, let us get started on the overall results on slide one, the highlights here. So we had $3.6 billion in net income in quarter. That's earnings per share of $0.82 on revenues of $28.8 billion. I won't spend too much time talking about where the results came from here because we will go through it business by business, but obviously it was great strength in the Investment Bank, and strong performance in the Asset Management, Commercial Bank and Retail Banking Businesses, as well as very strong results in our Corporate investment portfolio. The backdrop again, though, is that credit costs remain elevated. You will see that on various degrees of flattening and charge offs or slowing pace of increase, but nonetheless continue to be at high levels. We added $2 billion to the consumer credit reserves, though, to bring the total credit reserves to $31.5 billion dollars , which is obviously a very strong number both for the firm and each line of business. I will point that out as we go through. Overall reserve to loans for the firm of 5.3%. Capital - very proud of the capital level of the Company. Tier 1 common through the retention of those earnings, growth through $100 billion to $101 billion with a Tier 1 common ratio of 8.2% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.2%. Obviously, very strong capital levels. Slide two has everything I just described on it. I will skip that and take us to slide three, the Investment Bank. Here let's walk through the results in the Investment Bank. You see the circled number, the net income of $1.9 billion on revenues of a $7.5 billion for the business overall. I will just make one clarifying statement up front that a couple of the items you have been focused on in the past, together had an immaterial impact on the overall profit, the combination of two items. One is the tightening of credit spreads, a spread on JPMorgan's name and counter-party credit spread, DVA CVA as it's known, netted together for a modest net negative, and then we had gains of approximately $400 million, mostly realized on those legacy leverage lending and mortgage positions, mostly leveraged loans. Moving through, putting that aside let's move through the underlying real dynamics of the business. So investment banking fee line $1.7 billion, up a bit year-over-year and off some from the record quarter that we had last quarter, second quarter, where we booked something like $2.2 billion of investment banking fees. We maintained the number one year-to-date rankings across all the major capital rate and categories, so the Investment Banking franchise is doing quite well and continues to do so. The Fixed Income Markets line, revenues of $5 billion, and that obviously has the gains on leveraged loans that I talked about, bringing the total value of leveraged loans now carried on the books down to a market value of $2.2 billion or carried at less than $0.40 on the dollar. That's a 26% reduction from last quarter. So, we are likely not to be talking about that any more from this stage. And then, strong performance across most of the other products, really, in the Fixed Income Markets area. Equity Markets, similar story, $941 million worth of revenues, particular strength ongoing in the Prime Services segment there. The last thing I will comment on in the Investment Bank is credit costs. You can see the credit costs of $379 million over on the left, and the explanation there is that that is charge offs of $750 million, partially offset by release in allowance related to particular loans that got marked down in the quarter, for which we previously held our marks in the form of reserves. That's just a geography swing leaving us with well marked on a net basis between reserves and marks on those loans. But that was a release of $371 million to get you to the $379 million net number. Overall though, leaves us with 8.44% at the end of the quarter of reserve to loans there. Moving on to Retail Financial Services on the next slide, some of the drivers here, top half of the page is the deposit taking side, the Retail Bank. Here, as we said, I will point you to the circled number, average deposits $339.6 billion, up obviously versus a year ago, given Washington Mutual transaction this time a year ago, and declined as expected by about $8 billion from last quarter, as we let high-rate, high-cost Washington Mutual CDs, one year CDs, are rolling off mostly in the third and fourth quarter coming up. Everything else in the branch production side, we still have underlying good growth in the Retail Banking franchise, inclusive of WaMu and away from WaMu as well, and the WaMu integration continues to go quite well, with the last conversion happening in a couple of weeks here. So everything healthy and on track in the Retail Bank. Consumer Lending side down at the bottom of the page. Total firm-wide originations and renewals of credit total about $140 billion in the quarter, and $46 billion of that is what you see down in the bottom of this page in the retail side. That's $37 billion or so of mortgage loan originations, about flat year-over-year and down a bit quarter-over-quarter. Remember the real dynamic in that business is our exit of the broker channel in the past 12 months helping drive some of those numbers, replaced by activities more directly originated by ourselves. And then next is auto originations. You see about $7 billion of auto originations, we have done well in terms of market share in that business in the prime side, and particular strength this quarter with the Cash for Clunkers program. So moving to the next slide, slide five, for the income statement for Retail Financial Services. We will just take this in two pieces. So as you see in the middle of the left-hand side, the Retail Bank revenues of about $4.6 billion, up substantially from year ago given Washington Mutual in particular. We had profits of $1.043 billion in the quarter. So very profitable business in Retail Banking, consistent and up a little bit from last quarter. Then the other side of RFS is Consumer Lending at the bottom of the page, and driven by the very high level of credit costs that I will go through in the next slide of $3.8 billion which includes some additions, about $1.4 billion addition to loan loss reserves, we ended up having an after-tax loss of about $1 billion in consumer lending. So moving to the slide on the credit portfolios in Home Lending, let me just talk through that for a second. So here, slide six, I will start on the upper left with some of the overall commentary here. As we said last quarter, and then a month ago at a conference, we continue to see initial signs of stability in the consumer, early bucket delinquency trends, but we are not ready to declare that that's a sustained trend, but it is continuing to be what we actually observe. Another overall comment is that as far as the impact of foreclosure moratorium, the trial mods which have been very active in doing, and just the overall extension of processing of REO through the courts, those things are obviously having an effect on overall delinquency stats. But just want to make it clear that we are doing everything we can to stay on top of the income statements, recognizing losses through charge-offs and adding to reserves without regard for the impact that those factors would be causing in the overall delinquency stats. So with that, moving over to the left hand side you see the actual charge-offs for the quarter in the circle there, that totals up to about $2.1 billion this quarter across these three portfolios, down a touch from last quarter. So charge-offs themselves actually stable quarter over quarter, but obviously at a very high level, which is driving the business to the after-tax losses we saw. On the right hand side then, in outlook, I won't go through these piece by piece, but it is unchanged. Looking ahead to what we see, we are not changing any of these numbers, and obviously whether we advance to these levels is going to be a function of whether some of the early bucket delinquency trends that we described continue or not. Then the final important point, on the purchase credit impaired loans we acquired from Washington Mutual will be about $150 billion or so that we wrote down by $30 billion through SOP 03-3 at the time we did the transaction. Overall, that portfolio is behaving in aggregate as we expected. But we measure impairment at sub portfolio levels for purposes of accounting impairments, and so as we look at the prime portfolio, not option arms, just the prime mortgage portfolio, we see some weakness. We obviously measure that in terms of expected lifetime losses on that portfolio, and have added $1.1 billion that is put on the books in the form of a loan loss reserve as opposed to an incremental mark. So that is $1.4 billion -- $1.1 billion of the $1.4 billion loan loss addition in RFS or in Consumer Lending in the quarter. So with that, moving on to Card Services on slide seven, you see as expected, and unfortunately, a loss of $700 million in the quarter. That is fully driven by the continued elevated credit costs, high credit costs in the quarter, basically coming in consistent with what we talked about last quarter. So the charge off rates on the Chase portfolio, the legacy Chase portfolio as opposed to the run-off WaMu sub-prime portfolio, Chase portfolio 9.41% charge off rate circled there at the bottom on the left, up from 8.97% last quarter, trending toward the 10% plus or minus we talked about last time for where we would head by the end of the year, I'll get to outlook commentary in a minute. And we bolstered reserves here by about $600 million. On the revenue side, the dynamics here we continue to see, end-of-period outstandings circled at $144 billion, trending lower from the year ago and last quarter. And that is the factors we have talked about before, backing away from balance transfer business on our part in the marketing side, together with lower actual consumer spend on their cards, lower charge volume, as well as the charge offs, all driving outstandings down which puts pressure on revenues. And then the other piece is sales volume itself. You see circled $78.9 billion, excluding balance transfers that number is down 6%. It is down year-over-year, but we think we are actually holding our own and doing well in terms of share spend. But the overall market we believe is the factor driving the 6% year-over-year decline, and that obviously factors into the revenue side. So that, together with the credit costs, gets you to the loss in the business, obviously high level of stress on the losses in the Washington Mutual portfolio. So losses in this business we expect to continue as we said through next year, no different from what we said before there. On the Commercial Banking business, page eight, you see profits of $341 million, up 9% year-over-year. Continued good dynamics in this business. Obviously, credit trends are up, but revenues are up year-over-year, largely due to the impact of Washington Mutual. But at $1.5 billion, that along with very good expense management, gives us the earnings power to absorb a normalized credit environment. So you can see on the credit cost line, total $355 million of credit costs, that is on higher charge offs you see circled down on the left, 111 basis points of charge off rates for the business, up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but consistent with what we have talked about in this kind of economy, these portfolios credit is going to normalize. We end the quarter with more than 3, at 3% reserve to loans, which we think is very well reserved for the business. Next on Treasury and Security Services, slide nine, profits of $302 million, which is down both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Liability balances are down, and assets under custody, up a little bit versus the prior year. But the revenue side down 8%, with the big driver being declining revenues in the Security Services side, the custody and investor services business, that's abating levels of activity in securities lending business, together with overall lower liability balances in that business. So a disappointing revenue decline in WSS. TS down a little on the revenue side, and that drives the overall profit number of about $300 million in the business. Asset Management on slide 10, net income here of $430 million, up year-over-year, 23% on revenues of $2.1 billion, which are up 6% year-over-year. And you can see the spread across the various businesses, Private Bank, Institutional, and so forth. Really, continue to do well in the business here. Assets under management, $1.3 trillion, that is all the market level impacts on the business together with nice positive inflows of $113 billion for the past year and continued inflows of $34 billion in the past quarter. And investment performance continues to be strong and that, of course, is the necessary ingredient in this business. So overall, things continue to be doing well in the Asset Management business. And then lastly, on the income statement, is the Corporate Segment. I will spend a minute on this, page 11. So breaking it up into the pieces, you see in the box in the upper left, the net income box, so net income of $88 million in Private Equity, that's on revenues of $155 million, the first time we've had some positive valuations in Private Equity in a little while. The next line is important. That's Corporate, that's everything else inclusive of the treasury business and the corporate investment portfolio. Here, obviously a very strong $1.3 billion of net income. A couple of pieces there that are noteworthy, one is non-interest revenues of $900 million after tax, and that is primarily related to trading gains in the investment portfolio. I think of that as positions we own that aren't available-for-sale accounting. On those we had a separate increase in the OCI accounts of about $3.7 billion after tax in the quarter, but this is what runs through the P&L because it is mark to market. That $900 million is obviously a very strong number in the quarter. And secondarily, it's the benefit of the net interest income on the larger AFS portfolio, which is appropriate given where we are in the balance sheet demand from clients as well as the low interest rate environment. So what I will say here is that obviously the $1.3 billion number is high here for the profits of Corporate. We see that coming down to something more like $500 million plus or minus the after-tax positive in the next quarter or two, and beyond that it will drift lower to a more modest positive as we get to the middle and then through the end of next year. Of course, I'd caveat that, that is subject to the volatility of one-time items, but that's the dynamics of corporate. Capital on page 12, you see again what I said up front, we have $101 billion of Tier 1 common capital, $127 billion of Tier 1 capital, up strongly versus last quarter. And for the point I made about the improvements in OCI, tangible capital is up even more to the tune of $3.7 billion after-tax improvement in the AFS portfolio, which we still have. Capital ratios at 10.2% and 8.2%, we think are very, very strong. And on top of that, obviously the great strength of the earnings power of the Company and the $31.5 billion of reserves. So let me now just wrap up the quarter, and talk about outlook on side 13. So just to make a few points, much of this is familiar to you, but obviously in the Investment Bank, we are seeing great, great results in the markets
MIKE CAVANAGH: The point is that subject to the economy stabilizing and these trends continuing, which we just don't know, that is the point. If that were true, we are getting near the end of reserve building. But we don't know and we have to remain cautious about what does happen from here. If things worsen, we may need to do more reserve actions and that's the message, not really different from last quarter actually.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The preponderance of it is unrealized, Guy.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Obviously all of the AOCI, there was a few hundred million dollars of gains that were realized related to the AFS portfolio and the rest were unrealized values.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It is largely customer activity levels and change in appetite on products, but that's one business where we'll have to look and see how the rest of the industry performs, when we see some other results to get a firm conclusion there.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Our last number was $500 million to $750 million after tax, plus or minus obviously. And again all other things staying the same which we don't know, and it is hard to see given everything else going on in credit.
JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: This is Jamie. Let me give you a little on Card. The Card business is going through a substantial adjustment. We know that we have visibility to early losses next year. So we know we will lose a lot of money next year in Card, and it could be north of a billion dollars in both the first and second quarter. That number will probably only start coming down as you see unemployment and charge offs come down. And the UDAP stuff is a static analysis, we think it will cost that kind of number, but it does relate to how everybody else in the marketplace reacts. You have to do a better job underwriting up front. And you have to do, if you want to maintain your clients, a better job, I'm going to call it marketing, but think of it as rewards, services, and things like that to grow the business. So what we are doing in the Card business is really looking past 2010. And we have asked the people in the Card business to build new products, great new products clear and simple marketing, to do it where we have a competitive advantage; we have competitive advantage on the cost side, we think we have competitive advantage on the brand side, there's competitive advantage because of retail distribution. We think we're going to come out as a slightly smaller business, because people are going to cut back credit and subprime and places they can't manage the risk properly. But we think it will be a great business coming out of that. You won't see the results of that until 2011 and 2012.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess what we can follow up afterwards on the debt, the debt question. Generally looking ahead and holding aside the Investment Bank, which obviously has its own dynamics that aren't net interest margin related, and what we do in the investment portfolio, which is a deliberate decision about how we position the Company, which we have been open about, the rest of the businesses will run at relatively stable dollar margin. Spreads pressures are being actual run off of some of the consumer portfolios and general stability in the rest of the portfolios. On a dollars and margin and close to the same in percentage terms. For the overall company there's a lot of other factors that go into it, but the real dynamics there typically run through the investment portfolio and the Investment Bank.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Sure.
JAMIE DIMON: Well, capital is a little different because you are reading around the world. People talking about higher capital, liquidity and market and risk and size and god knows what, and changes in accounting and all of that. We are very well-positioned for all of that. We have plenty of capital. Remember, we have the amount of Tier 1 Common that was required in the SCAP test and all of that. So, but you are right, the two main regulatory issues are kind of front and center derivatives, and we really don't know how it is going to turn out. We hope it turns out in a rational way. We have been proponents of getting those derivatives into a clearing house, but we don't think they should be forced into an exchange. There should be room for over-the-counter -- you always read about they don't have capital, they're not regulated and all of that is just untrue. Over-the-counter derivatives, if you were doing it through a broker dealer, which is regulated by the OCC and Fed, have capital requirements and credit reporting requirements, reporting requirements and we think it is important that that businesses be allowed to exist to service customers properly. We don't know how it is going to turn out yet. It's kind of flip-flopping all over the place. And with all [ of them] forced on an exchange, that could have a material impact on the business, and on a lot of companies in America. That would change the way people had to do business in that area. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency again, -- everyone acts like that is a given, that will happen some way. I wish it weren't. I thought we had a change to streamline, strengthen and simplify our spaghetti regulatory system, and instead we are making it more complicated and more litigious, which over time will be more damaging to our country than not damaging. We are in favor of consumer protection, we just don't think that's the right way to do it. If you have to have a consumer protection agency, the most important aspect, the long-term health of the business, will be if you have proper federal preemption of states. You could draw a scenario where every state has its own rules and own requirements and own disclosures. How are you going to run call center -- the disclosure form for documents could be even longer and more confusing, litigation will be higher. And remember, all of that will be paid for by the customer. One of the great lies of this whole thing is that it won't. Anything like that would be paid for by the customer, and so we don't know how it is going to turn out yet.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, not a material thing. So we can carry that if you want off line.
JAMIE DIMON: Go on your balance sheet, and the investment portfolio is just another way of utilizing your capital and managing interest rate exposures and other exposure. But it is true that over time we built up that portfolio. We do it to make money. I mean, that's what we're here for. We are a profit enterprise. And we do it to balance off other exposures. When we create deposits, we have to buy longer term assets and things like that. Our interest rate exposure in a very simplistic way -- we do disclose this in the 10-K, I don't know what the number is today. But it is going to show that for 100 basis point one-time move in the curves it will cost us a billion dollars. We don't look at it in that simplistic way. We look at a whole bunch of different scenarios to make sure the Company is -- so in other words, it doesn't show we have a mismatch of $100 billion, and that's simplistic. We move that quickly so you shouldn't assume it will stay in a position like that. But we make other decisions, whether we want to buy mortgages, what's the mortgage basis, what are the other scenarios we're protecting against, so we don't take a tremendous amount of risk. We did see an opportunity in the last six months to put on some assets at good spreads, and the people in the investment office were allowed to go into credit products, and some trading products because you were being paid an awful lot of money to do it. Remember, that's what we are here for not just to be simplistic. And Mike said that number over time will come down because the portfolio will come down and the capital will probably be used elsewhere.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, you don't lose it all because your capital doesn't go away. You still get to do something else.
JAMIE DIMON: The MSR, as you know, is generally short duration, short volatility and short mortgage basis, which is mortgage spreads against slots or treasuries, and the general premise is that you're hedged against those things. Even when you're hedged you are going to have a lot of volatility because, remember you are hedging against the model. You will always have some volatility. There are occasions when we use the MSR to take the position you want to take on mortgage basis volatility or duration. And the question is, what's the cheapest way to do it. The folks in the investment office have the authority to do that if they think that is the best way to do it. But for the most part you are going to be hedged those three things.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It is integrated with the rest of the view of the portfolio.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we are not going to do it again. I don't think we're allowed to do it any more. It will reduce the charge-off rate by 50 or 75 basis points in the fourth quarter, and increase it by 50 or 75 in the first quarter, and obviously, we think it is net present value positive, but we probably won't do something like that again. A bunch of other numbers get affected. But we try to adjust for all of that.
JAMIE DIMON: It's standard. It is obviously more because you have more things and work out more problems. And the recovery rates are 5%, not 15%. So there are other things happening in Card. Card is having a tough time, but like I said we will take this opportunity to build a great business.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You did see it in that deposit margin which is on the Retail Banking on slide 4, a few basis point improvement as high cost debt rolls off.
JAMIE DIMON: Very high rates on those.
JAMIE DIMON: Exactly.
JAMIE DIMON: WAMU cost savings?
MIKE CAVANAGH: We're on track. It will all be done -- like I said, the final conversion and those savings will be in the run rate as we exit this year.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
JAMIE DIMON: I don't get your question totally, Betsy.
JAMIE DIMON: Right.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes, the reason -- remember one thing when you do a merger you have to also merge the product sets. So you have a change in the products and how they're being used. We've also had a change in customers and how they are actually using the products, stuff like that. So you are seeing both of those taking place in the WAMU branches, and the cross sell is doing kind of what we expect to do, we are adding the people
JAMIE DIMON: The real NSF changes we are making that we announced will be some time in the first quarter -we are going to allow, to have opt-in, and a new set of products and no more than three each day and a whole bunch of different things. The detail is being designed now. And think of it as a first quarter item.
JAMIE DIMON: I personally don't think there will be a lot. But Mike gave you a static number, $500 million plus or minus, but it is not static. How do customers really use things? And, if everyone does it, can you change your pricing a little bit? So my guess is you'll get back some of it but not all of it.
JAMIE DIMON: No, we are going to be testing some of that, but the answer is no.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It is in the hands of the government. So, obviously, we are awaiting what they choose to do. I think they're just trying to get their process nailed down to be a universal one, and hopefully they get that rolled out publicly soon, but the ball is in their court.
JAMIE DIMON: It doesn't affect our company at all.
JAMIE DIMON: I think, I think our goal is exactly the same as it was before, I think it was a 35% margin.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes, 30% to 35% pretax margin. We have put more capital in the business. So on an ROE basis, it is a different ROE, but pretax margin this quarter was 26%, 31% last. There's nothing wrong with that pretax margin target for the business over time.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That, and growth.
JAMIE DIMON: And growth.
JAMIE DIMON: We are not giving you a forecast. We wouldn't expect to earn these levels on a normalized basis necessarily, and that Corporate line is going to come down from $1.3 billion to $800 million to $500 million over time depending on the decisions we make. And in Cards, we don't know yet. So, we've seen a lot of the normalized earnings and it's kind of all over the place. But if you want to think ahead on the Company a little bit, with over $32 billion of reserves, whether that number goes up a little bit or whatever, when things normalize whether that's 2011 or 2012, it's got to come down to $15 or $12 or $10 billion. So you know you have that -- but you also know these other businesses will go, some will go from losing to making money. The underlying earnings part of the company is very powerful. That's what we try to build all the time, more branches, more bankers, more clients to drive that number in 2012.
JAMIE DIMON: It is after tax -- it's just an estimate of what the changes might do, and it's a very static number. Maybe we will try to get more information later, but it is a very rough estimate because we know you will be asking.
MIKE CAVANAGH: The changes in the policies in general, yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: So consumer portfolios, you have run off portfolios from Washington Mutual and Credit Card, and large ones in Retail, and obviously some tightening of underwriting standards in those businesses generally. So expect that at the origination levels, that for a period of time here we are going to have downward pressure on those balances. We're in the business of making loans against our underwriting standards today. So it is active supply, meeting demand on that score. On the commercial side, Commercial Bank you have seen a little further decline, loan balances down a few billion dollars to $102 or something like that this quarter. And that is more, it is a little bit of everything, but it is more demand clearly because we see extended credit lines utilized at the lowest levels of all time. You could see a swing in those numbers as soon as confidence returns in our commercial clients and they have some use for that money.
JAMIE DIMON: The Investment Bank, it is mostly corporations going to the market and paying down their loans. So the loans in the Investment Bank dropped from $90 billion to $60 billion over a year. So that was more than we expected, but to be expected.
JAMIE DIMON: Remember, the VAR is a good one point measure, but part of VAR is going down because you drop off some of the more volatile time periods that we're in the time series. But the trading was drawn across most areas, there's a lot of client flow and spreads are still higher than they were at the bottom. So, they're not nearly as high as they were after the crisis, but they're coming down a little bit. A lot of good client business and some good train around that.
JAMIE DIMON: I guess you don't necessarily make management changes for the next 5 to 10 years because you think you are having a good quarter or a bad quarter or something like that. In fact, very often you get caught doing it at the wrong time. You can't do it in a bad quarter, it won't look right. You just try to figure out what the right thing to do for long-term health of the Company. So I don't think it relates at all to whether you are having a good year or a bad one.
JAMIE DIMON: Yes. So I guess the way to look at it, the model is always being adjusted. And you are always updating it for home prices, housing turnover, prepayment models. And you do that at a very detailed level, and you do it differently for 4.5% mortgage, than 5.5% or high or low LTV and stuff like that. That is just updating constantly, and some times those model changes will have a benefit and some times have a negative.
JAMIE DIMON: No, I think it was mostly lower housing turnover and lower prepayment rates.
JAMIE DIMON: The number -- we also make judgments to continue regardless of the model.
JAMIE DIMON: On the housing market?
JAMIE DIMON: You know the data as well as we do. You have seen again the numbers, and of course you dig into them, you can always question them. But in half the markets in America of the major MSAs, you've seen stabilization, in fact an increase in the last couple of months, call it a stabilization of home prices. That was more true for lower priced homes than higher priced homes. But it also happens in places where price is down dramatically and where prices weren't down dramatically. And obviously Florida is still bad, parts of California we are seeing some improvement. We see that improvement in the MSAs where foreclosures are a high percent of sales, and we've seen it in MSAs where foreclosures aren't as high of a percent of sales. So I would agree with you there's a lot of distortion in that number, but all things being equal, it is a good fact, not a bad fact.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Trending a little higher. Remember it is the same message. Our reserves are probably good, but you probably have continued pressure on charge offs.
JAMIE DIMON: One great thing about that business, I'm going back to the old Bank One days when 60% or 70% of the revenues were loan-related, and now it is more like 40% or maybe even less percent are loan related. Now here we have a commercial bank with a very good return in a very tough time.
JAMIE DIMON: And they have done a hell of a job controlling their credit losses. And of course, we know that in tough environments they are going to get worse, but they have been far better than you might have expected, even up until now in this type of environment.
JAMIE DIMON: As you know, we are very careful in commercial real estate. That $12 billion -- the losses are 2.3%, we expect those to go up. We just don't think they're going to be a dramatic impact on the Company.
JAMIE DIMON: We have lending exposure, I just mentioned in the Commercial Bank. Obviously, some in the Investment Bank, but we wouldn't put those in a material kind of category, what makes us that nervous. And commercial real estate, the values have already dropped and it is going to be recognized over the next couple of years in people's P&L write downs, as people put up reserves and can't refinance properties and stuff like that. So, we believe you will see several hundred additional smaller regional based banks not make it. But there's also going to be a lot of capital eventually coming through into the real estate business as people try to recapitalize, and buy properties at good cap rates.
JAMIE DIMON: It could be an opportunity for us, not a negative over time.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Right. Clearly on the overall 30 plus delinquencies, that's where you get the distortion as things stay in buckets longer. I won't try to take that number down too much. You see those really in both of those buckets, so in percentage terms on slide 17, you do see those effects rolling through. On a dollar basis, it is stabilization that we are seeing across those portfolios, and again it is portfolios coming down.
JAMIE DIMON: The stuff is coming in the front end, is going bad for the first time, that is where you see stabilization. And then the actual roll rates, that is what deteriorates over time. We try to adjust on the delinquency side -- we keep all mortgage modifications and delinquencies throughout the trial process. That's actually driven up our delinquencies, not down. And Mike may remember what that number was, something like 20%.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes, 20% to 30% higher depending on the portfolio.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's in the total provisioning line. We took $750 million worth of charge downs. So carrying value of loans written down by $750 million. But on a loan-by-loan basis, many of those loans entered the quarter already having reserves up against them. So on a net of reserves basis, they were already on average carried at $0.60 on the dollar. So it's just a geography swing. We like -- on a particular, hypothetically, we like $0.60 on the dollar and we have a charge off event. So we charge the carrying value down by $0.40 and release the $0.40 of reserves we had. That's all running through the credit costs line. It's a release of allowance for loan losses.
JAMIE DIMON: It is different for every single product. It is hard to say, but a benchmark with 1x before the crisis, it got as high as 6x. And has come back to 2x. But it is really different for every product. 1x may have been unnaturally low and never come back to 1x, but the competitors are back which is a good thing for the industry. There is much more competition today and people competing both in the flow and reducing spreads.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me just talk to big picture, if you look at the FSA has spoken about, or the Financial Stability Board. We don't yet have the fed, the fed or the treasury put out their own guidelines, but most of those guidelines are global. If you at the pay policies of JPMorgan Chase, we have followed them. We don't have parachutes or change of control or special severance packages. We already pay people substantial amounts of their compensation in deferred comp and stock -- stock options we had called back for, I'm going to call, bad behavior and things like that. We already asked the senior people of the Company, the operating committee and the executive committee to keep a lot of their stock they ever get issued to them as long as they have their job, so they become substantial shareholders over time. We always looked at long-term sustained performance realizing that the rising tide will sell boats and the sinking tide can sinkhole boats. We have looked at the contribution people make to building a great franchise at JPMorgan, and that includes recruiting, how they treat clients, systems, not just financial results. We maintain those standards and we think have done it right and fair and continue to do what we're doing. Industries have to pay for performance over time, and we are committed to treating each individual, each individual properly.
JAMIE DIMON: Let me mention one thing about comp because it hasn't been. We also call back the operating committee for any reason. We can call back for almost any reason from the operating committee members. So, on dividend we want to give clarity. Obviously, shareholders rely on it, going into a bleak environment with the potential it could get even worse. The first goal became to protect the Company, but once we are convinced that is gone, we want to reestablish the dividend. We're always said about stock buy backs that that's on opportunistic thing. We buy back when we think it is cheap or the best thing to do with our capital. And we're not going to buy back when we think the stock is expensive or have better uses for capital. It will be unrelated to dividend, because dividend is a long-term decision to make for shareholders.
JAMIE DIMON: Look we are not -- what we see, you actually all see pretty much what we see, and there seems to be the stability in the environment in terms of consumer spending, confidence, in terms of delinquencies, a little bit of improvement in home price. Those are actual data, and that can be forming the base of a recovery or not, but we are not going to spend a lot of time guessing about that. The only thing I'd say anecdotally which we do get very consistently now is that business, small business, middle market, large corporate, the kind of poised and waiting to see the recovery is taking hold. So they have plans, financial plans and growth plans, so to me it would be a good sign if that's true because maybe people get a little more comfortable, they'll start making a little more risk and making more investments in the future.
JAMIE DIMON: The first thing is to get our own model right, own products and services and make sure we adjust to the new laws and things like that. If we think we have that right, we could be very aggressive in the marketing side. We are willing to make investments in our business once we are convinced that we are building the right kind of business. Our marketing budget so far for 2010 in Cards is up by several hundred million dollars, it is not down. But we will spend that money when we feel we will get a good return on it.
JAMIE DIMON: Almost every business is making investments. And Investment Bank is still making investments in Asia, and prime broker and systems, and Commercial Bank is building in the West coast, California, Atlanta, Washington, Florida because of the WAMU acquisition. Retail is still opening branches and adding sales people in the branches. TSS is adding products, Credit Cards is getting products, Asset Management is getting products
MIKE CAVANAGH: Next question.
JAMIE DIMON: Thanks, Ed.
JAMIE DIMON: The answer is under current accounting rules, yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I think there's growing pains in these processes. So we have been very active in getting modifications started. One thing, it is just still early to see how effective people are in making their payments, which is obviously one important thing. But the other issue there is just people complying with all of the terms of what is required under the Government's guidelines in terms of amounts and types of documentation before it can be declared. So there's still, I would call it growing pains in the process. So it's a little early to say it is stabilized and worked through. A lot of energy is going into it, adding a lot of people to it, us and across the industry.
JAMIE DIMON: The right way to look at it is, it is so large, the problems in housing today, we certainly hope there is nothing like this ever again. We have always had work out departments, the default department, the REO department, and it is just -- prime delinquencies of ten times what you would have expected, or losses, ten times what you would have expected in almost any environment. So it will come down to a much more normal thing, eventually, and you will have delinquency and charge offs and foreclosure that are just much smaller than they are today. It will never be this -- it will probably never be this big again in our lifetime.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It is no different than the same factors that drove through from originally subprime into our own prime portfolio, causing dynamics that look the same in terms of weakness in prime. It is home price declines and stress of unemployment, even reaching up into a prime segment to put stress on losses.
JAMIE DIMON: Thank you, Chris.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, it is no difference. Our guidance is I think $600 million of quarterly losses or 5 or 6 or whatever is on that slide for prime, which is consistent with what we said before.
MIKE CAVANAGH: No, no particular explanation on that one, they're just different portfolios. And we have been watching them and the standards of looking at them are a little different between the two.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Again, it really relates to -- remember in general and to over-simplify this. In general, you're forecasting forward assumptions of what your losses are and that's where your 12 months or 9 months plus the stress, that's what your reserve is. The hope is that what you said is true. But for that to be true you would have to see a little improvement in charge offs. If they stay where they are, yes, we don't have to reserve. If they start getting better, yes, reserves in effect, you will have too much.
JAMIE DIMON: We hope you're right.
JAMIE DIMON: I was just saying that the $32 billion will come down a lot.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That's reserves, too.
JAMIE DIMON: One of the criticisms of this whole thing is that a lot of the policies are all pro-cyclical in reserving. So we went from $7 billion in reserves to $32 billion, it is going way back down again. It's going to go back down again in a predictable thing once you start to see improvements.
MIKE CAVANAGH: We don't know where the level is going to bottom out at, but we hope it is a less pro-cyclical a regime once we get to that point in the cycle anyway.
JAMIE DIMON: Not really when it comes to loan losses. If I was a regulator, I would change loan losses early and not be so pro-cyclical.
MIKE CAVANAGH: With less volatility.
JAMIE DIMON: That would be fine with us.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: That was going back to the point of making sure we are taking the P&L impact early of some of these problems, getting our repurchased reserves fully caught up and consistent across our portfolios was a several hundred million dollar impact that swallowed up the production revenues in the quarter. It won't run at that high level, the repurchase reserve. Looking ahead, it will still be something though.
MIKE CAVANAGH: I believe it is going to be flattish to where it was. But you will see that in the Q. That's a little bit of a function of you need more time for things to move into that categorization, something like six months after the restructuring is on the books and performing, then it will move. But we can follow up with you off line on that one.
MIKE CAVANAGH: It's not different than anything we said already. We have long had a management philosophy of running a company across all of these businesses have very strong liquidity and very strong capital, thinking of it as a strategic imperative. Not worried about where you could run your returns if you lightened up on that, because we're just not going to. We think we can always run these businesses for a good return, with that kind of approach, if we do everything else right with the kind of franchises we have. So really what that translates into just the investments that Jamie referred to earlier, the consistence, that advantage that we have is that we don't get distracted and continue investing in growth across all of our businesses through thick and thin. When things are a little thin, often it's the best time. That's why we are actively doing all the things to inject growth into existing businesses, and hopefully see that in healthy growth when you go out two, three, five years across all of these businesses. That's where it translates into P&L.
MIKE CAVANAGH: You are cutting out a little bit, but I think in terms of the FAS 166, 167 stuff is expected January 1, 2010. That's when we expected -- obviously until that data is here, the authorities there could just decide to delay, but that's not our expectation. The point is for us it is very manageable at these ratios.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Yes.
MIKE CAVANAGH: Great. Well, thank you, everybody. We appreciate your dialing in. Look forward to next quarter. Bye.",0.31000000000000005,-0.41399999999999787,0,0.08042377796988417,0.09979201813485543
